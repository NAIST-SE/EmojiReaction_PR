Merge upstream normally, reverting any undesired commits individually via additional commits from git revert.
Rebase the upstream commits onto the divergent downstream branch.
Cherry-pick the upstream merge commit, resulting in a single non-merge commit containing the squashed upstream changes (git cherry-pick -x -m1 UPSTREAM_MERGE_COMMIT).

Option 1 would become rapidly unmaintainable as the number of undesired commits grows, and would make things awkward when previously-reverted commits are accepted later. The git history would be crazy.
Option 2 would work decently, but would be difficult in practice for larger changes or for sufficiently-divergent bases. Rather than dealing with merge conflicts on the overall merge result, conflicts would need to be dealt with every step of the way, even when the associated commits are ultimately immaterial to the final result or irrelevant to the diverged base.
That leaves option 3, which works absolutely fine with the exception of the loss of underlying history, but that may just be a fact we need to accept. When changes are backported in this manner, they really are separate and new changes, and thus warrant fresh commits.",True,{}

Looks like the terminal is being freed during normal connection cleanup, but prior to the SSH client thread finishing. Depending on timing, attempts to write to the terminal by the SSH client thread segfault since the terminal was already freed.

Yes, that's what I meant by the comment above.
The thread in this case is the SSH client thread, created to handle the underlying SSH connection after the first user joins:
https://github.com/apache/incubator-guacamole-server/blob/d35cc7a83e8dfdaa44cbd3b02c70e9407197155a/src/protocols/ssh/user.c#L56-L70

This creates a race condition which could result in data being written by the client thread to the freed terminal, causing a segfault. The fix may be as simple as switching the order of those lines, but such a change will need to be carefully verified. The SSH client thread depends on certain conditions for the thread to terminate. If switching those lines results in a chance of those conditions not occurring, then we'll be replacing a low-impact segfault with high-impact deadlock.
The SSH client and input threads should probably take the client running state into account (the value manipulated by guac_client_stop()), to ensure they will terminate regardless of the current state of the terminal or underlying SSH connection.","From upstream GUACAMOLE-384:

Support for configuring SSH host key checking (#191)


Backport known dependencies through the usual ""cherry-pick"" method:

Migration to the new unit test tooling (#193)
Additional string utility functions within libguac (#194).


Copy over the RDP support from the glyptodon/2.x branch verbatim.
Make as minimal changes as possible to bring that support back into compatibility with glyptodon/1.x:

Use the common session recording API that was part of 0.9.12 guacamole-server (no recording of input events)
Remove trace-level logging (not part of 0.9.12 libguac)
Remove use of Guacamole protocol error codes that were not part of the 0.9.12 version of the protocol
Correct calls to the common SSH utility functions.
Remove reliance on the user timezone handshake (not part of the Guacamole protocol until way after 0.9.12)
Remove any settings not already part of glyptodon/1.x, #190, or #191.



With these changes made, glyptodon/1.x builds against FreeRDP 2.0.0 just as glyptodon/2.x but remains completely compatible.","This backporting effort is significantly more complex than others due to the size of the changes involved and the way those changes have been built on the various other changes made since 0.9.12-incubating.
To manage to backport things successfully, this set of changes takes the following approach:

Backport features that would both be beneficial and would reduce the amount of manual changes required to make the FreeRDP 2.0.0 changes compatible:

Support for configuring the SFTP root directory (#190)
Support for configuring SSH host key checking (#191)
