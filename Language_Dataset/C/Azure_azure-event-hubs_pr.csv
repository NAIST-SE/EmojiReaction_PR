Issues were being opened and not being tracked which I really hate to see. For any type of issue, there is a better channel to report it than this one:

Documentation issues/feedback -> File an issue here https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs
Library issues/feedback -> File an issue in the respective repo
Service-side issues -> Open a support ticket on Azure (which comes straight to our team!)
Service-side feedback/requests -> I'm in the process of getting something like this setup for Event Hubs

Once we have the feedback forum setup, adding the correct support/feedback channels to the README on this repo may be a good idea.
Now, with all that said, our goal was not to make this repo seem ""gutted"". Is there anything that you feel is missing now that you appreciated? Is there anything else you think this repo should provide? We'd love feedback on this and we're willing to implement good ideas as they come in 👍
Thank you for taking the time!
