Taking a look, maybe even 4.3.2 is okay (testing that now).  Yup, even the 4.3.2 compiler on a Fedora 10 system is modern enough not to need that -V option.

One thing to note about those top-level Makefiles: they were not written for general use, but for creating distribution binaries on very specific machines.  It is on those machines that I would like to test.
On that note, we would only change active Makefiles or the ones under other_builds, not alter historic Makefiles.  Maybe I should move the old ones to a sub-directory, we'll see.
At any rate, I will start looking into this change, but will do so slowly.

a recently changed AFNI default is to auto-detach from terminal, which is probably more convenient for most users. There is just one small limitation if you use drive AFNI in a virtual X11 server environment (Xvfb) executed e.g. like this: 
xvfb-run -a --server-args='-screen 0 1280x1024x24' afni -com 'SAVE_JPEG A.axialimage sss.jpg' -com 'QUIT'

XIO: fatal IO error 11 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server "":100""

My bug fix was rather simple and easy to share - just add the flag '-no_detach' to the afni drive command and all works as in previous versions.

Remember that Matlab uses one-based indexing. With n elements, the for k loop makes k have values from 1 up to and including n -- not from 0 up to and including (n-1) as in the C language.
So if n==1, then the first loop iteration has also k==1, the guard if k<n evaluates to false, and no separator is added.

>> unsplit_string({'foo'},'XX')

ans =

foo

>> unsplit_string({'foo','bar'},'XX')

ans =

fooXXbar

It appears that the make build on circleci did not have the development version of python installed. #136 fixes this (and makes sure cmake and make have identical system installs from now on).
Additionally, it appears that the make build on circleci does not currently build SUMA. Since it is not the vastness/itall difference perhaps it is the clean etc that is done before the build that causes this deviation. I will investigate that further.

This now checks explicitly for the suma error:
** ERROR: glwDrawingAreaWidgetClass is NULL
   This might be an error in GLwDrawA.h where the class is
   not referenced using 'extern'.  An alternative is to use
   the local build of libGLws.a.

I've encountered this repeatedly because homebrew and debian both ship the library in a form that breaks our build (the patch in the neurodebian repository has not yet been upstreamed). A quick fix is using -DUSE_SYSTEM_GLW=OFF, or resort to the GLw header modification hack by modifying the file installed on the system. Hopefully the longer term fix is that we upstream the change but for now at least an error from the undefined symbol occurs at build time rather than runtime.
Regarding the plugin error you encountered on OSX. Send on the error when you have a chance.  I can't reproduce it.",True,{}

— leej3#13","Oh in that case this likely shouldn't merged. The principal reason for #154  is to allow more advanced users to install the python code into an environment for isolation/tying the installation to a python interpreter. It's true it serves as a stepping stone for a standalone pip installable package but there's a lot more to it than that. Having a pip installable package will only be especially useful when we have incorporated the C binaries into a pip wheel.
Agreed with Rick on the formatting changes. In general it would be nice to have the style more pythonic and conformant with pep8  etc. but fixing the large diff that it generates should typically done in a separate commit and is often not worth it due to the obfuscation of the git history.",True,{}

The second of these two commits, 8ccdbb8, is just a URL update in setup.py and a version bump; the first commit, a9831f4, is an update to several scripts (lib_afni1D, afni_base, afni_util, lib_timing, lib_vars_object & module_test_lib) from Python 2 syntax to Python 3.

was there a specific use case you had in mind?

We use lib_afni1D in some unit and regression testing for C-PAC (eg, https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/blob/a6528ff9a2aea810fea6786a636dcf703ce2a943/dev/circleci_data/scripts/compare.py#L239) and are working to remove Python 2 dependencies from our package.
I didn't find a Python 3 version of lib_afni1d, so I

forked this repository
ran 2to3 on lib_afni1D and its internal dependencies
went through the automated changes and make adjustments
pip installed from my fork and tested my use case
updated the URL and build number in setup.py
opened a PR

git config --global alias.deprecate '!git lc >> .deprecation.txt;git add .deprecation.txt; git commit -m ""Code removal""'
After changes to build/licence/docs etc. one can add all of the C code changes in a single commit. Then running ""git deprecate"" will log all of the files changed, who dunnit, timestamp etc.
Subsequently if someone wished to restore the functionality, or just check how something was implemented they can do a quick search through .deprecation.txt",True,{}

General improvements for test execution
Rather than resorting to bash scripts etc, testing functionality has
been consolidated into a python script run_afni_tests.py. The scripts
functionality itself is heavily tested so hopefuly moving forward this
will provide a robust interface to testing the full codebase.
The tests now run reliably on MacOS (with known failures Xfailed as
required)
Parallel test execution now works well. Race conditions for test data
download, Xvfb buffers, communication ports, Xquartz displays, and
environment variables have all been fixed so the more cpus the faster
the execution of the test suite. pytest-xdist was essential for this
(over pytest-parallel) because of the isolation it provides between
running tests. Additionally, lockfiles are used for the other race
conditions (process locks that worked with pytest-parallel will not work
here).
Timeout functionality is added for testing. This can be very useful some
times for commands that are known to hang across different executable
versions. It is also required for failures of suma, which when
backgrounded and listening on a port will never close...
Coverage testing
The coverage setup originally added by Ross Markello has been restored.
Previously, using coverage inflated the size of the development image to
18GB. A number of changes have been made this less of a problem. Among
others, the cmake build is now used, which uses shared libraries for all
libraries.
Additionally certain aspects of the build/CI infrastructure have altered

mrilib now has no X dependency
mcw_malloc memory stack monitoring is no longer used
the circleci setup is more modular and tag-specific jobs are being
used to reduce baseline resource usage.

Running coverage every push to github seems excessive but updating the
coverage for every release is now manageable.
Circleci/docker improvements
Circleci testing has been improved in a number of ways. The details of
data caching are now encapsulated in the python tool (permissions get
tricky as the user needs to be root on circleci but likely won't be
anywhere else). Additionally the executor used across the different jobs
has been homogenized.
Circleci executor changes were previously explored in #211. The solution
used here is to define an afni executor (docker image
afni/afni_circleci_executor) that contains all dependencies required on
circleci. The advantage of this is that now all circleci jobs can be run
locally using the circleci local CLI. The downside is that caching
test-data becomes more convoluted.
circleci mounts the host docker service into the executor as described here:
http://jpetazzo.github.io/2015/09/03/do-not-use-docker-in-docker-for-ci/
The circleci executor now has docker v19.03, which supports chown upon
copy. This chown on copy drops the size of the image. It also gives the
make_build access to /opt/afni/src (previously it was not worth the
increased image size to chown it)
run_afni_tests.py now manages test data during circleci testing. As
suggested by the circleci docs, it creates a container and mounts a
volume to it and then shares that volume with the main testing container
using the ""volumes-from"" option. Trickiness regarding
permissions/ownership are handled along with this.
Testing graphical user interfaces
The gui testing has proven extremely different to get working. The main
challenges were working with Xvfb (xvfbwrapper provides a more pleasant
interface from a pythonista point of view), race conditions for ports,
and the fact that suma does not raise non zero exit codes and hangs
indefinitely when a failure does occur. Additional challenge was working
out how to get opengl functionality working on MacOS using Xvfb (I
believe it is not possible unless Xquartz is recompiled with indirect
GLX support for Xvfb frame buffers). The solution was to run all suma
tests on the physical display of MacOS with the appropriate locking to
prevent race conditions.
Test data management
Test data for the testing suite is handled using datalad. This allows
convenient management of recursive git-annex repositories so large data
trees can be represented on disk without all of the data actually data
being there. Data management should not have afnipy as a hard
dependency. As tests are executed data that only exists as a symlink is
downloaded. Race conditions previously stymied robust behavior here but
it is now working really nicely. It has been encapsulated in the
data_management.py module for ease of reuse.",True,{}

Updates on 2020/10/26 will remove some of the current circleci virtual machines (well actually 'descale', but its a slippery slope from there!).

For information on remote docker on circleci see this:
https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/building-docker-images/
A more recent version of remote docker is now explicitly defined to avoid any issues when the deprecation does occur.
Previously for the deployment step (pushing docker images to docker hub upon version updates) the virtual machine circleci/classic:201711-01 was used. This has been replaced here with the docker image docker:18.01.0-ce-git along with remote docker. This necessitates some fixes because the docker image is far more minimal (alpine OS is used).

Hi,

I have an M1 Mac. Can you send me your executables to run AFNI natively? I would like to test them for my data. My email is ***@***.******@***.***> or ***@***.******@***.***>.

Thank you,
Dalton

A temporary fix for 3dClusterize tests where the output diffing does not occur is added for now to pass the tests until the test data is updated appropriately.

If that is the case, I think that is resolved---there was two issues that I could tell, each just involving a tweak of ""#include .."" statements:  in one case, for SUMA_input.c, an ""#include .."" pointed to a package that was just on a local machine (but we that dependency wasn't necessary, so could be fixed just by commenting that line); in another case, for 3dNwarpCalc.c, the recent addition of an if-condition required putting two simple ""#include ..""s in one branch of the condition.
@leej3 , could you please verify if these have resolved the issue(s) you were referring to?

In my experience, it is useful to have a tool that can help detect both identical as well as equivalent results. For example, an x86-64 computer will provide different results for a 32-bit float multiply-accumulate computation if you use the FPU (80-bit internal precision), SSE (64-bit), or a specialized AVX FMA instruction (64-bit, but one less rounding). Likewise, there are often differences when one uses a different architecture (NVidia Cuda, aarch64, x86-64). For this reason, I find it useful to report the most extreme difference between voxel pairs. Consider comparing two 4D images where the r is identical (1.0, at least to machine precision):
Images Differ: Correlation r = 1, identical voxels 73%
 Most different voxel -69.3133 vs -69.3133 (difference 1.52588e-05)
 Most different voxel location 43x17x49 volume 39

Image 2 Descriptives
 Range: -472.393..491.385 Mean -0.00121971 StDev 6.8898

My intention here is to slowly expand the tool if people are interested. This is pretty much the ""minimum viable product"" for my use case, but there are significant other ways to expand the usefulness:

Add code to match the data types, or else upcast the less precise one and then compare (this is much more tricky, and for my immediate purposes just coercing to float32 actually works pretty well).
Add features to diff header elements. For example, if one file contains a header extension and another does not.
Print out what the differing dimensions are.
Intelligently determining whether the voxels diverge because they have different values, or if there is an implied mask (left has a 0.00--unlikely in floating-point for a real value, but right has a non-zero value; most likely this means that masks used to generate the images diverge, not necessarily that the underlying computations are different), and counting that up.
(As you mention) the minimum and maximum divergence in values; to be truly fancy, fill out a histogram.
Add Python bindings so that you can easily run diffs for testing frameworks such as pytest (any python implementation I've tried is just unbearably slow).
Add a -q flag to match the diff behavior of the same name: Just stop if there are any differences at all and return non-zero.
Add the ability to diff entire directories, which would let you do a little bit more seamless estimation of how much that ""small change"" impacted your data processing.

I'm sure there are other ways to improve things, too, but this is what I have off the top of my head. I do want to keep the program as light as possible; right now the runtimes are something like 250MB/s of diffing and I'm happy with that.",True,{}

What do you mean about ""parsing""? There are format specifiers in C, for reading and writing scientific notation.  %e and %g are useful ones for scientific notation:
Consider this C program, for displaying scientific notation:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main( void){
   float a = 100;
   float b = 1000000;

   FILE *fff = fopen(""file.txt"", ""r"");
   float a, b, c;

   fscanf(fff, ""%e"", &a);

   printf(""c as f:%f\n"", c);   
   printf(""c as g:%g\n"", c);   

   fclose(fff);

   return 0;

b as g:2e-06
c as e:3.000000e+07

I think that reading them in as THD_3dim_dataset types would be preferable to doing so as MRI_IMAGE types.  This should be more general, and allow for more standard flexibility of input naming, as well as verifying the consistency of multiple input dsets like for matching grids, etc.
In fact, this has inspired an update to 3dToyProg, or at least a separate kind of educational ""starter"" program with comments, with many inputs from @afni-rickr.  This is now in the code base: 3dEdu_01_scale.c (https://github.com/afni/afni/blob/master/src/3dEdu_01_scale.c).  I think this might be useful for tweaking the way inputs are done and reading in the data.  The output should be even simpler in your case with 3dDiff because you aren't outputting a dset, but instead numbers.
Please let us know how that seems.  (I expect we will make some more 3dEdu* progs, too, eventually.)",True,{}

To your question about naming inputs:  indeed, switching from -left and -right makes sense to me.  Whether to go for, say:
A) ""all files at end of command line""
B) explicit opts per file (-a/-b/... or -dset1/-dset2/...)
C) single argument that can take one or more files (e.g., ""-infiles .."", like 3dmask_tool uses)
D) other
kind of depends on the future expanse of this program.
I might suggest B or C.  The appeal of ""-a/-b/..."" (or ""-dset1/dset2/...) is brevity for 2 files, easy expandability for a few more, with possibilities for communicating text output about them by referring to each by their letter (or number).  Also, if the program expands, someday you might just add a ""-infiles .."" argument, to allow for lots of input datasets.  So, by the end of this paragraph, something from ""B"" for the moment, and possible expansion/change to ""C"" in the future.
Separate note:  the testing framework has finally been fixed (by the magical Yarik), and the shorter-term issue with CMake is also resolved in the current master branch.  So, I might suggest that you pull the master branch into this one---hopefully, there shouldn't really be any conflicts (maybe just minor Makefile stuff).

I see.  From a scripting/programming point of view, having either all or the [0]th output be a clear ""yes"" or ""no"" seems appealing to me.  This could take the form:
1 25 16777216
... to show that yes, there is a difference (the leading 1) in 25 out of 16777216 voxels, and
0 0 16777216
... to show that no, there is no difference (leading 0) in 0 out of 16777216 voxels.  Note how the 2nd zero is still present, even if unnecessary, in order to keep the same number of outputs regardless of whether there is a difference.  Also, there is no text here (and even all a single type---integer), so it's easier to read in.  I think these features would help implementing this program in a script.  From this information, someone could readily calculate percentages, if needed, whether with a shell script:
#!/bin/tcsh

set vals = `3dDiff -a DSET1 -b DSET2`
if ( ${vals[1] ) then
    set perc = `echo ""scale=10; ${vals[2]}/${vals[3]}"" | bc`
    echo ""++ The percentage diff is:  ${perc}""
else
    echo ""++ There were no differences among the ${vals[3]} voxels.""

OK, I just ran the current code, and get no output for -a/-b dsets being the same, and this example for differencing:

++ Images diverge: 146997 of 211200 voxels disagree (69.601%)

OK, that looks good.  Are you sure you want to be in the business of evaluating header differences with this program?  I think I would take the approach of ensuring that the two input dsets are on the same grid (in the deep sense of 3dinfo -same_grid ...) and returning ""fail"" and nothing else if those headers don't match.  If they did match, then you could proceed with everything else.  This would shorten the output checklist, too.
Basically, I would think users should use 3dinfo to compare the header information (it's already good at that), and then this 3dDiff program would be about voxelwise/elementwise differences.  If the datasets have the same matrix dimensions but different placements in space (due to any part of the [q,s]form matrix), I wouldn't think a voxelwise/elementwise comparison would be possible/meaningful.  That kind of partitioning of comparisons (header for 3dinfo, data/brick for 3dDiff) seems useful to me.

// load in A and B

if( (dset_A == NULL ))
   ERROR_exit(""Can't open dataset '%s'"", input_nameA);

   [delete/free dset_A and dset_B]
   [exit program in whatever fashion you are ending]

[... all the code to do the dataset testing/comparison that you want, because you survived the fireswamp of mismatched datasets]

In this way, your output should be simpler, rather than the current 8 numbers:
Brutalist output is useful for scripting. The output is an 8-integer 
array with the following elements:
	0:	Summary (-1 failure, 0 no difference, 1 some difference)
	1:	Dimensions (the number of differing dimensions)
	2:	Grid Spacing (0 if no difference, 1 if some)
	3:	Image Center (0 if no difference, 1 if some)
	4:	Obliquity (the angle of difference)
	5:	Orientation (0 if no difference, 1 if some)
	6:	Elements (total differing elements, -1 if cannot)
	7:	Total Elements (total elements compared, -1 if cannot)

... you can get rid of items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  So, you get the benefit of simpler reporting (only 3 numbers needed to output).  Basically, getting a ""-1"" as the first output can mean 'some kind of header difference---dear User, if you are unsure or surprised, prithee check ""3dinfo -same_grid ...""' (or some other non-brutalist message).
If you add in a mask at some point, sure then that just would add a second comparison---check that dset_A and dset_B aren't mismatched, then check either of them with dset_mask.

Slightly late to this party, which has been going strong this morning!
I think it would be better to just focus on 3dDiff, rather than mirror this functionality in 3dinfo, too.  At present, it seems possible to have have a simple option in 3dinfo, but I imagine the desired functionality of 3dDiff will quickly grow---as soon as you mention adding a mask (which seems a natural addition), then this no longer is in the realm of 3dinfo.  Then, you are stuck with awkwardly duplicating, or branching, or something else that can be avoided.  I am quite surprised that 3dinfo has -val_diff, actually... though I aaaaalways learn surprising things about the code base.
Many programs in AFNI work volume by volume---I suspect this would be a handy model here.  Rather than going for Nvox * Nval, when contemplating multivolume data, why not just treat each 3D volume separately?  The output could have N rows, then, one for each:
0   0  100000
0   0  100000
1 20  100000

You could also have a separate option for just one, summary row, either keeping the same format or adding a 4th column (number of volumes):
$ 3dDiff -a dset1.nii.gz -b dset2.nii.gz -diff_across_time
1   20  100000 3

... where now the 4th column is the number of volumes (in lieu of 3 columns, with the final value being 300000).  Even if there is only 1 volume, it could be there.  It isn't so wonderful changing the format output, perhaps (3 columns of numbers to 4), but at least if the user adds that option explicitly, then they can know what to expect.
It also seems more meaningful to me to leave the Nvox and Nvalue info separately reported---can be useful to know, and most Nvox and Nvals are not so easily to decouple.

Found differences in X of N volumes (P%), with total differing voxels ranging from A elements (a%) to B elements (b%)

Another potentially dumb question: why not add the LIBMRI_OBJ dependency to those files? It's already present in many of the makefile lines and proofs it a bit against future me.

3dinfo is generally best for getting info about a single dataset, and often for header-related items.  There are some data-related ones (e.g., min and max values), but that is rare.  There are a couple cases for comparing multiple files---namely, in that section you have pointed to, with the semi-commonly-used -same_grid, which performs the role of THD_dataset_mismatch() in shell scripts.  But for the most part, data-querying functionality tends to reside elsewhere happily, because it often gets more complicated such as by adding a mask.  Perhaps even the -*val_diff options exist in 3dinfo because a timetraveling or alterate-reality-hopping JBT put it there, before realizing that programming a new C progarm would be even more fun than editing an existin gone.

That is a very large number of diffs (a high-res, 50k volume dataset) that would lead to that.  But you could guard against it in a few ways:

putting a ceiling value on the number of diffs (2**31, say)
outputting the number of diffs as 5.0e+9 (that is, jumping to %e for printing output)
outputting a -1 as the second number, to signify that the number of differences are ""a lot"", in a technical sense:

We don't really do a lot with the Matlab codes here (as you might have noticed...), but it is good to know they are still useful.

My point indeed is that I can come up with a local workaround, i.e. interpret the *.HEAD header information on our end (i.e. adding some stuff to our local version of the file readers) but perhaps it's better on the long run to synchronize on both ends.
Sure I can provide some test code or demo the functionality. Also, no problem for me to update the functions' documentation a bit. Will do.",True,{}
