Syntax
    expression:
        assignment-expression
        expression , assignment-expression

Semantics
The left operand of a comma operator is evaluated as a void expression; there is a sequence point between its evaluation and that of the right operand. Then the right operand is evaluated; the result has its type and value. 114)
EXAMPLE As indicated by the syntax, the comma operator (as described in this subclause) cannot appear in contexts where a comma is used to separate items in a list (such as arguments to functions or lists of initializers). On the other hand, it can be used within a parenthesized expression or within the second expression of a conditional operator in such contexts. In the function call
    f(a, (t=3, t+2), c)

the function has three arguments, the second of which has the value 5.",True,{}

many plugins aren't really maintained, even by their maintainers.  That's the problem of GP: we want some standard out of it, but maintainers don't necessarily answer.  Another approach could be arbitrarily dropping plugins when they have something we'd like to fix instead of proposing a fix.
some are happy we do some of the work.  And that's mostly fine, although some should also show more concern :)
some never answer PRs, neither refusing nor accepting them.  Which is the problem here, you probably should have refused it.  It's fairly complex to remember not to PR something here but other things there, for which part are here (e.g. build system should go on GP, but code changes on upstream, which then should be imported back).

Alright, I confess I didn't know there was other upstream than GP for this plugin - I assumed upstream was the GP version. And looks even crazier, you Lex were a maintainer of Matthew's plugin in GP? How did that work? You were watching Matthew's repository for changes and applying them to GP? And if someone made a pull request on GP, you took the patch, made a pull request on Matthew's repo?
IMO it would be best if GP was upstream for every (maintained) plugin - both for the development reasons (like applying patches to all plugins at once when some change is made in Geany, verification that something didn't break for all the plugins etc.) and also user perspective (all plugins at one place).
Of course everybody is free to decide whether he wants his plugin part of GP or not but if he wants to keep a separate repo for development, he should make sure the two are in sync (and it should be one person taking care for both repos).",True,{}

Sure, we can't force the maintainer to stay.
But as it's a forked plugin nobody would maintain, we might want to consider removing it altogether instead of getting an ""unmaintained version of a maintained plugin"" as @techee rightly put it -- which, if it stays that way long enough, is rather counter-productive as many people would use an outdated version of the plugin while they could use the upstream one (which indeed has less visibility than the already established GP, but could be used/packaged just fine -- or so I hope).

That's not really true, you can just fine host your GP fork wherever you want.  Of course if you want your changes to be integrated into the combined release, it has to be pushed back to the repository where this happens, but that's no different from anything else.

and even it's own (standalone) Autotools build system.

That shouldn't be a problem: what's the advantage of own separate build system that we couldn't get in GP?
You can configure a single plugin and leave the rest alone with --disable-all-plugins --enable-yourplugin.  If that's not enough, we could probably make it even more friendly, I don't know, like --enable-plugins=yourplugin or something, whatever's convenient and not to hard to do.
And most people suck at Autotools, so most people are generally happy whenever it works, not wanting to know anything else about it -- so not having to maintain it seem like a bonus rather :)

It's still a little annoying having to maintain separate Autotools files for inside GP vs external, but it's not so bad (at least with Overview which is trivial to build).

Hum.  I don't know how submodules work, but won't that often become a problem to maintain the separate build system?  Maybe not really much more than currently, but currently it's all together so it's fairly obvious it has to be updated.
But well, if submodules need to be updated manually, I gues sit's a matter of PRing properly the update.
But it still duplicates work.

In a perfect world external plugins using Autotools themselves also could just add AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS and re-use their existing (sub) build system, but I fear that would be more complicated, and I know it would be more slow.

Well, that'd probably be nicer in theory for self-containment, but currently any external plugin that want to do things right have to re-implement a lot of GP's build system checks and features.
I'm not sure how easily this can be done, but I guess it would require to have a separate build system stub (well, possibly only Autoconf macros) that external plugins also use.
So, really not trivial.  But it would profit external plugins even not linked to GP.

I noticed Travis' Autotools doesn't support AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS, but we could do it other ways […]

You can probably use ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -Itherightdirectory in Makefile.am, see https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/autoconf.html#index-AC_005fCONFIG_005fMACRO_005fDIR-62

With a fork of GP, you carry along all the extra files and git history and Github Issues and stuff of plugins you don't care about.

what's the advantage of own separate build system that we couldn't get in GP

Ability to use own (non-Autotools) build system, or to use non-recursive automake, or just to have a much simpler and light weight Autotools build system.

And most people suck at Autotools

Thats why special options like --disable-all in combination with --enable-foo=yes aren't ideal if a plugin wants a standalone distribution.

But it still duplicates work

It does, but it separates it too. GP requires special autoconf macros and boilerplate files and stuff, so it's not a huge deal having a separate non-GP specific (potentially Autotools) build system, IMO. The redundant boilerplate in GP becomes just like the boilerplate/metadata needed to put packages in a package manager, just a way to get an external plugin distributed with geany-plugins.

but currently any external plugin that want to do things right have to re-implement a lot of GP's build system checks and features

Is there really that much it would need to re-implement? Maybe some gettext stuff, possibly something like --with-geany-libdir and own check like PKG_CHECK_MODULES([GEANY],[geany])?

You can probably use ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -Itherightdirectory in Makefile.am

IIUC @sardemff7 tried it and it still had the issue I experienced.

What would be the best (from what we see in geanyplugin.h) way of reloading the build menu from the config files? I'd like to add this explicitly because right now switching between non-project tabs with geanyprj loaded doesn't update the working dir from e.g. filedefs. [0]
I can't call build_menu_update(doc); from a plugin because the linker doesn't see its implementation. Is this supposed to be in geanyplugin.h <- build.h and we should also build build.o from Geany core and link it (help welcome) - or is it not supposed to be used from plugins?


[0] Currently I just unset the path instead of keeping it on the last geanyprj value. Setting it to the lowest priority (GEANY_BCS_DEF) doesn't help because the last value still lingers in higher priority. Being able to have two files from separate projects open in tabs next to each other is the killer feature of geanyprj, and works nicely with working dirs now, but probably others would like it to reload filedef paths when tabbing to a non-project file.",True,{}

Comments/improvements welcome.","@elextr I'm aware that it shouldn't be needed, it was just one attempt on the way of achieving point 1. So, understood: no usage due to not being in the documented API :)
Probably fixing build_remove_menu_item() should be handled in a separate bug report.
Side note: the changes presented here work nicely when switching between geanyprj projects and also when loading a Geany core project file.
My issue is that when tabbing from a geanyprj file to a non-project file, the build menu needs to be repopulated as given by the file type and geany.conf.
I can't play with the current GeanyBuildSource values because chosing below GEANY_BCS_HOME_FT is not enough to make geanyprj settings show up, while using GEANY_BCS_HOME_FT or GEANY_BCS_PREF lets the project paths linger (not get updated) at non-project files due to same priority in the respective cases.
One solution would be a plugin API that lets me reload stored settings from the config files (which I don't see currently).
Another one would be to introduce something like GEANY_BCS_PLUGIN either higher than or just below the GEANY_BCS_PROJ entries, so plugins get their own place for build menu changes.
Thoughts?
EDIT: the third option, which I'm currently using, is to simply not honor (i.e. unset) non-project settings for the working dir entry.
Also adding a separate priority like GEANY_BCS_PLUGIN has to consider two distinct plugins racing to write their paths there...",True,{}

Changing the API number won't help anyone: the prefixed name exists since basically forever, so there's no real point in adding #ifs in some code for that.

And changing neither of those will change the fact plugins using old unprefixed names will need to be changed to build against the latest Geany.

Your patches look good (I reviewed only the patches dealing with the undo stuff and didn't spend much time looking at the menu feature but it seems to work fine). I've just squashed your whitespace fix to the original commit and left the rest as separate commits. I've also updated README and added the REMOVED_MARKER_POS() macro.
The last patch is one more minor modification - it updates the cursor position when undoing deleted hunk - originally the cursor was placed at the position where the hunk started but I think it should be placed at the end of the undone deletion which corresponds more closely to what normal undo does. The question is what to do with modified hunks (i.e. those with both old lines and new lines).

Well, its perfectly legal C to assign int to uint, and there are old time system interfaces that use int where they only return positive values and actually should have used uint, so the warning is spurious (and unfixable) in some cases.  Thats why it is not included in -Wall and -Wextra.
The less used warnings tend to be ones that can cause more unsuppressable spurious results, or just plain stupid results (see a recent discussion between @b4n and I about returning small structs from functions that was triggered by one of his warnings 😉 ).

Note that if you had 1024 nested directories like
first/second/third/.../1024-th

the current code will still need to open all the intermediate directories for traversal and you'll get the issue during project load.

Finally, calling ldconfig /usr/local/lib on the command line before building geany-plugins did the job 😓 (So, yes I am using Ubuntu).
I tried to do it automatically by adding it somewhere in the Makefiles but failed because I just do not know anything about the principles of autotools/automake. And I have to admit that I do not want to work into it because I dislike make to much and the autotools do not seem to make the job simpler.
Although I think that it is a little shame that the libdirs are not the same amongst the different linux versions.
Anyway, that's not our fault.
Now that it works, how do we proceed now? I would like to place a fresh PR which only includes the changes for the common lib (leave workbench unchanged in that PR). Once that is merged I would place a PR for workbench which replaces the code.",True,{}

more in the future), we should emphasize this in the NEWS to help distro packagers when releasing. They probably need to add something like geany-plugins-common package and make all other plugin sub packages depend on this (as it is already on Debian).

If you want to keep gtk2 after all, elextr's suggestion of splitting the plugin
into separate gtk2 and gtk3 versions might make sense.

Ok, I did not realize that it is opening the local file. Will remove it from this PR.

I fail to see what value these changes give, given that the ""old"" API is fully functional (we spent some effort to make sure it'd still work flawlessly), and the new one, while nicer, doesn't provide any actual new feature this plugin would need. This looks like a change for the sake of change, which I don't really fancy (one reason being a bug likeliness to improvement ration very low). Also, if this gets done, it should fully embrace the new API philosophy and try and get rid of the global variables (unless actually problematic).

Hmmm....well it is not a change for the user in terms of functionality of course. But IMHO it is not just a change for the sake of change but a change for consistency and cleanup. Also, there was some reason to design the new API or not? The new API seems to be more easily extendable. This does not matter right now but maybe in the future if a API change/extension is required. I thought it would be nice to have all plugins using the new API and throw away the code which is required to support the old one.
And maybe I should not say ""new API"" but current API as it was introduced in Geany 1.26 (November 15, 2015).
Anyway, I should maybe have opened a discussion before starting this one. So I say sorry for my ""bold"" PR flood. This is your plugin, if you rather like to keep it like it is then I accept it of course.",True,{}

I sympathize with the idea of using current APIs in general.  However, as said we made quite some efforts to make sure the older API is still fully functional -- and if you check Geany's code, it's basically a compatibility module which does not add complexity to the actual loader :)
So yeah it's likely some new features could be exclusive to the the API, but it's unlikely we'd have to drop support for the old one.  And while it could indeed be nice for cleaning up some of Geany's code, we like avoiding unnecessary burden on plugin developers -- the reason why we went to great length not to drop the old API at first.  Remember that there are some plugins not on this repository.
So… I'm feeling kind of conservative here, but I'd prefer to see this kind of changes as part of a development effort on the plugin, suggesting interest and testing in that very plugin -- because yeah, it seems like a fairly innocent change without too much risk, but…

Also, there was some reason to design the new API or not?

Yes, mostly to make it easier/possible to write ""proxy"" plugins that can load other plugins (like https://github.com/kugel-/peasy).

Anyway, I should maybe have opened a discussion before starting this one. So I say sorry for my ""bold"" PR flood.

Well, don't get me wrong :)  I like the initiative of proposing changes and writing the code. Yes, sometimes discussing it ahead can save a little time (mostly on the person actually writing the code), but so long as you can accept ""no"" (or ""please change this that and that"") as an answer it's all good.
And despite what I'm saying that I don't really like changing working code for something that isn't tremendously simpler or adding new features or fixing bugs, if @frlan or other want it to happen I'll be fine :)",True,{}

Please also see the discussion in #703. It's purely for consistency/cleanup. I wonder if there is a new API why not move to it. Otherwise the old one will/can never be deprecated in the future. Anyway - as written in the discussion I would of course accept if you do not like to merge it.

Maybe one question - what Geany API does this change require? Is the currently used API version specified in the plugin enough?

According to https://www.geany.org/manual/reference/legacy.html it's deprecated since Geany 1.26, don't know the API version. But it is NOT obsolete and there is NO plan to remove it. So it will just work fine.
So as writen above I will accept a ""no"" without any discussion and the change is only because I think it's nicer to not use a deprecated API even if support for it will be ongoing.",True,{}

I was asking because if the API version used by the plugin was older, you'd have to bump the API too. But I've just checked and 226 which the plugin uses corresponds to the 1.26 release so it's OK for this plugin. But you should check other plugins too.

I took the sources of the Geany 1.33 PPA, applied your Geany patch (I ignored the GEANY_API_VERSION hunk as that failed to apply), then built with dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -nc and installed the resulting packages.
I'm not sure if the Geany patch is still necessary though given the comments in the PR, and I see that you did a force push but I can't find the original commit hash to compare with.
I cloned your branch and built vimode, copied vimode.so to ~/.config/geany/plugins and enabled the plugin in Geany.

I get the block cursor so it seems the plugin itself is enabled. However it does not seem to capture keys correctly, i.e. typing text inserts text, Ctrl-W closes the current tab and pressing keys when text is selected replaces the selection. Pressing escape does not seem to have any effect. I did not change the vimode options. Note that viw behaves the same way.
Feel free to ignore if it's clear that it's my fault.

The only thing is that IIRC there are a few real issues with the webkit2 version that got merged, and it'd be sad to release with them, if they really exist.  I might (or might not, no promises) have time to review and fix the issues before next release, but if people find and fix them already even better.

That was my issue with the Markdown changes, and it was somewhat fixed in follow ups, though I'd like to improve it to still support all of the versions of webkit it's known to work with (the versions/package names are confusing but I guess webkit-1.0, webkitgtk-3.0, and webkit2gtk-4.0).

For the project-before-save event the following code would have been run (with conterm=FALSE):
	guint i = 0;

	plugin_idle_add(geany_plugin, settings_saved, GINT_TO_POINTER(conterm));

	foreach_document(i)
	{
		if (utils_attrib(documents[i], SCOPE_LOCK))
			documents[i]->readonly = FALSE;
	}

And function settings_saved looks like this:
static gboolean settings_saved(gpointer gdata)
{
	guint i = 0;

	foreach_document(i)
	{
		documents[i]->readonly = scintilla_send_message(documents[i]->editor->sci,
			SCI_GETREADONLY, 0, 0);
	}

	if (gdata)
	{
		conterm_load_config();
		conterm_apply_config();
	}

	return FALSE;
}

The code in if (gdata) is not executed in this case as gdata would be FALSE. The function is also called on the event save-settings and then conterm/gdata is set to TRUE and the config will be reloaded. This still works fine. If I e.g. change the terminal background color in the preferences the change is applied immediately.
I wonder what this READONLY check is good for. Can the document status change by changing/saving the project?
As I never have seen the six years old code in action I can't see any difference and it looks useless to me.
Maybe there were plans to also save some scope settings in the project then it would make sense to also reload the config at that point. But all settings which scope loads in conterm_load_config(); come from geany.conf.",True,{}

Great, good to hear!

Yeah, I think it's not worth it. I was thinking about some config option to disable showing empty directories (which would kind of kill the ""create directory"" feature for users who would enable it) but I think I'll wait with this and see if users are complaining about it or just don't care.

Correct. I have put some Gtk and Vte compatibility stuff in the common utils lib as there was no attempt for shared compatibility code yet. Also, regarding Vte I wanted to prevent that the utils lib always depends on Vte even if no plugin is enabled which uses it. That's why there is this ""cross-reference"" in the makefiles. I didn't know a better way to do it. If there is a cleaner way for archiving this then I am open for suggestions.
Vte compatibility code might not be used often but there are definitely some plugins which still need to be ported to Gtk3. So I have made a first attempt to introduce some code in PR #750.

simple test under Ubuntu with GTK2 and 3: run a program in the debugger, have some breakpoints. Inspect some variables. I clicked some icons and dialogs, nothing seems to be broken.
I did not test the GUI extensively (that means, I did not make a checkpoint list of all debugger related icons and menus and tested each of it)

One very minor thing.. when debugging a program that uses ncurses, I was able to view the screen in the Debug terminal as expected. The cursor keys worked within the terminal fine.
But when I hit the green arrow (continue button to move past a break point), I have to click back in the terminal window each time, otherwise the cursor responds in the document editor window.

Ubuntu 18.04.02, gtk 2.24.32, glib 2.56.3: the arrow is showing

Just in case you did not notice because ""the down arrow is missing"" does not describe the problem I noticed very good. I would say enabling the debugger plugin on gtk3 causes the menu bar in the message window to have a fixed size. It is not shrinkable/growable any more. So the arrows are gone. Also the menu items are not reduced any more if the height of the message window is too small (I mean that usually e.g. only two menu items are shown if there is only space for two and then you can use the arrows to reach the other buttons).

This was successfully tested on Centos 7.5 with stock development packages.","I've looked into it and from what I can tell this is normal behaviour.
The main Geany GUI uses GtkPaneds for side panels (document browser, symbols, messages...), including the bottom one. When such a panel is too small to display its contents, the latter is located in hidden overflow.
This also happens for the left panel if you resize it: try to drag the splitter to the left, you'll see that the left arrow will slide under the left border of the main window. The exact same thing happens with the debugger plugin if the botton panel becomes too small. Or put more exactly: too small for the right button panel to fit un the bottom space.
So IMHO this ""bug"" is unrelated to the debugger plugin but is a general Geany GUI issue.
I can see two possible resolutions:

Fix the main Geany GUI so that the side panels don't overflow either by enabling an automatic scrollbar or by specifing a minimum size the panels can't be shrink under (which I think is the best one);
Add a scrollbar specific to the whole debugger plugin panel, with possible ergonomic issues.

I also checked the GTK+2 behaviour : it simply doesn't honor the plugins minimum panel size. When you shrink the panel so that it becames too small, the controls collapse one above another and the GUI isn't quite usable anymore. This isn't better IMHO.
BTW, on an unrelated note, I'm going to rebase the branch on more current code. No other change beyond that.",True,{}

I have made some research and CSS seems not to be appropriate for setting dimensions. On the other hand the correct way to fix it seems to be the Glade file. Changing <property name=""shrink"">True</property> to False (Geany release 1.34.1, geany.glade line 8452) doesn't allow overflow for the bottom paned for instance. But as I said just before this has to be fixed in the main Geany repository and has nothing to do with geany-plugins.

It's a good question, but it will always be better than the current situation that returns a more or less random value -- I'm not sure if it's undefined or implementation defined behavior, but GCC seems to return 0.
In practice, this seems to lead to no change if the Python function doesn't return, but allows it to return a value that will be passed along.
If you want returning True as the default case, I'm not sure what the best solution is but maybe simply assuming None means ""didn't return a value"" might be good enough, as it's the default return value, and not a valid value for an explicit return.

The problem is kinda tricky in real situation because this feature is more or less broken in Geany, as there's no real way to tell which handler will be called first, so it only works if all handlers on the same binding are well-behaved.
Anyway, to test, for example make a GeanyPy plugin with 2 binding handlers that do something visible (log a message or something). Then, bind those both to the same key combo, and see they both run.  Now, try and follow Geany API to return True in the handlers, which should prevent the other ones from running.  Before this patch, both still run.

It works like suggested by b4n and also allows spaces but it does only work on the current line.
I wanted to write unit tests for the function that parses the current line and extracts the expression to evaluate. But my unit tests don't build. I have setup an extra folder tests. In it are the test files. If I try to build the tests via make check then compilation for the scope unit tests fails because check.h cannot be found. Another thing is that if I remove the comments from scope/tests/Makefile.am then none of the tests source code files is compiled. It now looks like this:
#if UNITTESTS

include $(top_srcdir)/build/vars.build.mk
plugin = scope

check_PROGRAMS = scope-check

scope_check_SOURCES  = unittests.c utils_test.c
scope_check_CPPFLAGS = -DTEST

scope_check_LDADD    = @GEANY_LIBS@ $(INTLLIBS) @CHECK_LIBS@

Junk! I simply forgot to install check on my machine (embarrassing). For anyone reading this: make sure you have check installed if you want to write unit tests. Otherwise you might get an error message like this:

I first thought I could use gtk_container_add() on gtk 2 and 3 because of this deprecation notice in the gtk documentation:

gtk_scrolled_window_add_with_viewport has been deprecated since version 3.8 and should not be used in newly-written code.
gtk_container_add() will automatically add a GtkViewport if the child doesn’t implement GtkScrollable.

But the function only works that way under gtk3. A test with gtk2 revealed that the function does not work that way with the result that in this case the scroll bar was missing in the autoclose configuration dialog.",True,{}

So I have written a function which returns the required info. Why am I getting that stock-id's at all under GTK3? Is the geany core still using them on GTK3?

If this library was statically compiled into each plugin (don't think it is), you could probably use g_module_unload.
If you wanted to cover 99% of the cases (GCC or Clang) automatically, you could use the destructor attribute, like maybe:
#ifdef __GNUC__
#define GP_UTILS_DESTRUCTOR __attribute__((destructor))
#else 
#define GP_UTILS_DESTRUCTOR
#edif

GP_UTILS_DESTRUCTOR
void gp_utils_finalize(void)
{
    // ...
}
Alternatively, you could add two functions like gp_utils_init and gp_utils_finalize that could be called from each plugin which uses the library, to initialize and cleanup internal memory of the library.

Also I do not want to create the hashtable I use per caller but share it among the plugins.

Then it would probably have to go inside Geany I suspect, or Geany would have to link to and init/cleanup the utils library, which is sort of counter to its design.
Since stock items still exist in the current major versions of GTK+ that Geany supports, it seems like a lot of work/waste to avoid some deprecation warnings, IMO. Maybe you could make some wrapper header/macro that disables the deprecation warnings in specific bulk-deprecated headers like gtkstock.h or whichever, and include it first before other headers? The deprecation warnings are annoying, but they just mean ""Will be removed for GTK+ 4"", pretty much.
Edit: I also just noticed the G_GNUC_*_IGNORE_DEPRECATIONS macro, maybe tricky stuff could be wrapped directly like:
#if GTK_CHECK_VERSION(3, 10, 0)
G_GNUC_BEGIN_IGNORE_DEPRECATIONS
#endif
      if (GTK_IS_IMAGE_MENU_ITEM (node->data) &&
          gtk_image_menu_item_get_use_stock (node->data) &&
          gtk_stock_lookup (gtk_menu_item_get_label (node->data), &item)) {
        item_label = g_strdup (item.label);
        use_underline = TRUE;
      } else {
        item_label = g_strdup (gtk_menu_item_get_label (node->data));
        use_underline = gtk_menu_item_get_use_underline (node->data);
      }
#if GTK_CHECK_VERSION(3, 10, 0)
G_GNUC_END_IGNORE_DEPRECATIONS
#endif

To be clear, I don't use geanyvc, so I won't spend time understanding enough of the plugin code to be able to review the change, similarly setting up a sacrificial git repo to test it.  Especially when related to git workflows and stuff.
Although it would be preferable that some other user (like the OP of #285) tests it, in the end if it sits too long and nobody does then IMHO if the plugin maintainer says so (and the build passes) it should be merged.

update_editor_menu ­– GeanyLua is capable of sending signals to other Geany components.  So it could send a signal to a component that could interact with the menu.  Or a user may wish to take some other action that doesn't require direct interaction with the menu.  Lack of creativity does not make it useless.


key_press – Are you having a real problem with the signal, or is this just hypothetical?  On a properly functioning system, checking whether the file exists takes a negligible amount of time.
On my computer, it takes just under a second on average to check for a nonexistent file a million times.  That's about 1 microsecond per keystroke.  That amounts to about 4.38 min of processing for someone typing at 100 wpm for a year non-stop.  I've already lost more time just reading your messages than I would have lost to the plugin over many years of normal use.

I suggest all the signal scripts be checked for existence at plugin start, not checking the file system every signal.

What problem does this really solve?  Only 1 microsecond is spent per keystroke checking that the file exists.  That results in 4.38 min for a year of non-stop typing at 100 wpm.  Even pro-writers would be hard pressed to lose more than 30sec per year of normal use to the checks.  Meanwhile, performing the check once at startup eats up programming time, introduces the potential for bugs, and wastes users' time when their scripts don't work and they have to research the command to update the plugin state.  The time lost to those activities would add up to many times what would be lost to the file check over many decades of normal use.

... the inode will be cached by Linux...
But when the calls are not in the same closed loop the caching may not happen so well...

The inode will also be cached when even the slowest two-finger typists are actively typing.  The access time would have to measure over 100 ms to be noticeable to someone typing over 120wpm.  If that were to happen there is probably something else seriously wrong.

or even not at all with some mount options.

What mount option?  In this case, the file simply does not exist, so there isn't even an atime to update.

And for a remote file on a network (where the default is to ask for new metadata if the requests are more than 3 secs apart) there could be intermittent delays while typing.

I suppose someone forced to keep their Lua scripts on a high-latency remote server would have this problem.  In this case it's not enough to just check for file existence at startup.  The scripts themselves should also be cached.  I'm willing to work on this if I hear from someone with commit privileges.

Since the cost is incurred only when the plugin is enabled, ultimately the decision is up to the the plugin maintainer, Geany doesn't really care.

Unfortunately Geanypy has now expired due to one of its dependencies being stuck on GTK2.
Because plugins are made by individuals with few additional contributors (mostly) they tend to not have the effort available to keep up with changing dependencies and expire when the dependency does.

I recently saw, but haven't tried, another scripting plugin for Geany (peasy). Since it uses gobject introspection, it presumably has access to all of the API.

That is made by a regular Geany contributor and (IIUC) makes plugins written in scripting languages ""first class"" plugins and could replace Geanypy and Geanylua albeit with a different API since both of those attempted to make the API more OO and ""native"" in the respective scripting language and Peasy is direct translation of the Geany C API.

As far as I can tell, the newer versions are incompatible, and porting would be a pain.

Unfortunately Geanypy has now expired due to one of its dependencies being stuck on GTK2.

Distros are also dropping python2.  So if it wasn't one thing, it would probably be another.  I had a version of my preview plugin for Geanypy, but switched to GTK3 a long time ago.

Ok, so the plugin lifetime is until Lua 5.1 EOL or distro removal.

Was surprised to learn that Geany was still being built with GTK2 on Windows.

The windows (like Mac) build system is the work of one person, so they needed to have time to update it.  IIUC the new system will allow Geany and tools and dependencies needed to build for windows to be dockerised so its easy to build, and I think even cross build.

Removed extraneous nested parentheses from the parameter check for missing arguments.
Added switch to ignore some lexer messages because lexilla is now separate from scintilla.  It was pointed out that messing with the lexer could cause problems elsewhere in Geany.
Combined the near identical argument-handling switch statements into a static function.  The number of scintilla types went from ~10 to ~70.  Keeping the switches separate could lead to potentially difficult to track problems if they go out of sync.
Added new types to the result switch.  Basically treating most types as int.  This can be shuffled around later, as needed.",True,{}

I like the ""open directory"" and ""run terminal"" features (maybe I'd just prefer ""open terminal"" so it's clear that when you invoke it on some script, it won't run the script), but I'm not so sure about the ""open externally"" feature. The ""open externally"" feature could potentially execute some code from e.g. scripts and I'd like to avoid such things from inside the plugin, especially when it can happen by accidentally selecting a wrong row in the menu.
The configuration option (especially for the terminal) is probably useful, it would just be better to have this as a plugin configuration (the one you specify in Edit->Plugin Preferences or in the plugin manager) and not a per-project configuration option - you want to set this once for all your projects and not on a per-project basis. The plugin currently doesn't use this configuration window - if you want to implement it, you can check some other plugins how they do it.

just a warning, every time you force push you are likely to break the copy others are using for testing your changes, which is likely to annoy them.

I force pushed here because @techee asked on another PR for me to combine commits.  So I assumed that was his preference generally.  How would I do that without a force push?
For Geany, a couple were because of conflicts that would need to be resolved manually.  The rest were just because it's fun to rebase.  I'll refrain from any more of those.

The travis failure isn't you, geany_lua is broken and that stops the build. Probably the build should be fixed one day to continue to other plugins even if one fails.

#1123 fixes the build issue.  @Skif-off Seems to think it's prudent to wait for geany/geany#2930 (Scintilla 5.1.3), but in that thread there's talk of waiting for 5.1.4.
If there are no new data types, the changes are auto-generated.  So if it's holding other things back, the only real downside to just merging and regenerating the file again later is another PR.  If scintilla only add symbols, without removing any, the next update could be delayed further with the only consequence being that new messages can't be used.
I don't really know how to test all those symbols or if they were even really tested in the past.  If they'd go largely untested anyway, the new code to handle the new data types probably just needs a reasonableness check for now.",True,{}

Better call it ""Open File Manager"" and ""Open Terminal"".

Will leave creating a general configuration for another PR, since it potentially affects another PR.

I was going to suggest that myself. But since I really don't like having this configuration inside the project configuration, I'd prefer if the configurability of these commands could be removed completely for now.

Removed the folder and terminal toolbar buttons.

Good.

Moved ""File Manager"" and ""Terminal"" options lower in the menu, but away from ""Delete"".

Good point about the Delete, I just wanted to have the ""find"" commands at the top of the menu.

kept g_strdup because it's needed to prevent segfault on g_free
combined get_fullpath and get_folder
added ""open"" to the menu item labels
removed config

Also gdb is not finding OS libraries or header files for the target OS (not finding a thread library might trigger the first issue, actually).

I use geany on the desktop because the Raspberry Pi has no display, and no GUI environment is installed. Not to mention that a Raspeberry Pi Zero may be slow for geany..

I didn't think it had any compatibility checks before, thats why it refused to compile with a version of libgit2 that had reserved not asize.
I probably have not explained my concerns well enough.
I am not an expert on libgit, but IIUC the change in libgit is not simply that the field name was changed, but that the field is now unused.  But this patch still tests and assigns to the unused field.  But whatever value it is testing for will not be set, and whatever value it is trying to pass will be ignored by libgit, because the field is unused.
It seems to me that if the test is still needed or the value is still supposed to be passed to libgit then we should be testing something else, or passing the value somewhere else, not using reserved as if it is still asize.",True,{}

Closes #1164.","Good point.
I think it could be ok, git_buf_grow is called only once in the code directly and in all cases I've tested the asize field was non-zero, i.e. the git_buf instance was allocated by libgit2 and so the custom code in gcb_git_buf_grow was never used.
However, either I'm wrong or there was a previous use case where this was necessary. As long as I don't know this, it's hard to say what's correct.
Interestingly, newer versions of libgit2 (I think it was since 0.23 or so) even do not allow using git_buf_grow with a custom allocated buffer and raise an error instead. So if the plugin would use a custom allocated buffer, we probably would see errors (or at least warnings in the logs). Or I misunderstood the code.

Closes #1164.","@elextr is right that the logic wouldn't make sense if we just started using the reserved field instead -- although in most cases it would still actually work -- as the code gives it a very definite meaning.

So if the plugin would use a custom allocated buffer, we probably would see errors (or at least warnings in the logs). Or I misunderstood the code.

Indeed, that probably just shows that despite the documentation git_blob_filtered_content() never actually returns an internal buffer. And looking at the code, 1.4 doesn't seem to ever be able to do so (in a mostly reliable way ATM).

Anyway, I created #1178 which should solve it, although it still makes an assumption on what the API actually does no matter what the docs suggest (yet, the docs have had a history of not being up-to-date on developer's mindset), which unfortunately is the only way to avoid unnecessary copies in the common cases.

Fixes #1069","Just for the record, a comment about the fix to @nomadbyte , i have been using the debugger with very good results with  Geany 1.37 (git >= 5cc69b3d) . I don't know if anyone else tested this fix with newer Geany. I was more interested in debugging multi-threaded applications but recently i had to debug minicom to mimic some of its features in one local application here and depending on where i set the breakpoint (in minicom), the next [Step over] closes Geany. minicom is a terminal program generally used to communicate with some hardware via Serial/USB interface (most common use). If you are interested in knowing more about the issue, please let me know. Or if someone would like to find more, a tip to debug minicom is to comment the setjmp() code and then you are able to set breakpoints anywhere. Maybe the interrupts set by minicom are the main cause. BR.",True,{}
