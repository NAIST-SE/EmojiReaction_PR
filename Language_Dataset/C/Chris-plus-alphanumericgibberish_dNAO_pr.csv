In terms of what to do about it, I am rather torn.

To me (being gay myself) this line should be preserved not for sentimental reasons but for posterity.

This PR reverts msgtype=stop behaviour to the regular '>>' prompt in curses, but enforces space, enter, or ESC. to dismiss prompt, rather than any key (the original behaviour, which was dangerous because keystrokes could get out of sequence and messages could be missed).
It introduces msgtype=alert for the <TAB!> prompt behaviour (which will fall through to msgtype=stop behaviour if the windowport does not support alert).
It also adds support for msgtype=alert to the tty windowport.
We've been running this code on hardfought on other variants for some time now.

artifact crystal sword
when wielded by a male character

grants energy regeneration, half spell damage, and boosts spells while wielded

Reference to Callandor, a male sa'angreal from the Wheel of Time series. Notable that it amplified the taint, thus the the san loss, but also heavily boosted spells. Possibly could have a negative effect of some sort on your health as well after prolonged usage (ala tensa z?).
I'm not really expecting this to be merged, just fyi. If you do that's cool, but it probably needs some more fine tuning.","It is intentional that it uses initgend. There's a character in the books (aginor?) reincarnated as a female, but that still touches the male power. Ideally I'd also case this to only be given to initgend males, and possibly add a female one as well later at some point (there aren't as many notable female angreals).
Autocursing is a thought, but my goal is to try to make it easily usable with but with a price (which could get annoying with cursing). It may thematically fit though.",True,{}

d10/d8 base damage, uses bare handed combat skill (but is a wielded weapon, so gets no bonuses from gloves or anything like that). without the beast's embrace glyph it's just that with no other special modifiers.
with the beast's embrace glyph (which is generated with a 1/4 chance on every werewolf in the depths, so you've got around a 40% chance to have at least one, it gets pretty big bonuses. the beast claw itself does sneak attacks. it doesn't get any other main hand bonuses. however, if you're wielding nothing in your offhand you can two-weapon (even if you can't two-weapon) to add a pretty great claw attack (which takes the place of your offhand weapon attack).
the claw attack is just AT_CLAW AD_PHYS. the number of dice is <lvl/8+1>, so 1-4, hitting 4 at xp 24. the die size is based off your current insight level. unlike the other two insight-related weapons in the game, you want minimal insight. the die size is (spe + ((60-insight)/20)^2). that comes out to spe + 5 at insight 15, spe+1 at insight 40, and spe+0 for insight 60. it can't go lower than max(spe, 1).
at level 30 with 15 insight and +7, the claw will deal 4d11 damage, in addition to the d10/d8 + 7 from the main hand weapon attack. that's pretty good damage i think.
It's worth noting that the claw + sneak attack both requires the glyph to be ACTIVE. The insight level is set to 15 for that glyph, so it won't ever trigger if insight<15, just like any of the other glyphs I think.

Nothing -- you will continue to get gifts from sacrificing corpses on altars, and at mostly the same rate.

Grants double spell damage & eregen when wielded
Uses wand of orcus zap rules, since they're built-in for all artifact wands

Doesn't do half spell damage like callandor or have good base damage since it doesn't lower sanity.

To be honest - I have no clue how the balance on this is. Same with Callandor. Recently i've just ended up using C for artifact donations, and this is a wand of striking for consistency with spawn location. I'm not convinced letting them spawn there is a good thing, but Callandor at least should stay as a crystal sword? (rod can become a wand of light). It is quite thematic that it spawns in a tower though.
Why did I make this? I thought it was dumb that Callandor is still in there being sexist and there's no equality. Not sure adding a new arti is the best solution but w/e.","Adding an artifact breaks save compatibility, so this needs to be submitted to a dev branch not a compat branch.",True,{}

Say you want to write:
int mynums1[] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
There are 6 things to set. You'd then use SET06:
int mynums1[] = {SET06()};
And SET needs to have defined what default values to fill into each:
#define DEF01 0
#define DEF02 0
#define DEF03 0
#define DEF04 0
#define DEF05 0
#define DEF06 0

If you want to initialize the 4th element of the array as CLR_BLUE,
int mynums2[] = {0, 0, 0, CLR_BLUE, 0, 0};

The Goal
I want to be able to instantiate a structure without directly specifying every bit:

struct mythingA = {""name"", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0x8|0x1, 0};
struct mythingB = {/*something easier to read*/};


What does SETnn do?
SET01 sets exactly 1 parameter:

struct mythingA = {a1};
struct mythingB = {SET01(/*something*/)};

SET03 sets exactly 3 parameters:
struct mythingA = {a1, a2, a3};
struct mythingB = {SET03(/*something*/)};


How does SETnn expand?

SET03(args)
-> SET(03, args), SET02(args)
-> SET(03, args), SET(02, args), SET01(args)
-> SET(03, args), SET(02, args), SET(01, args)


What does SET do?
SET(nn, args) fills exactly one field, the nnth.

pline(""%d  %d  %d"",
       SET(01, args),
       SET(02, args),
       SET(03, args));

If args contains an argument that is supposed to fill the nnth field, it uses that. Otherwise, it uses a default value.

How can SET set a specific field?
SET(nn, args) knows it has to grab an argument that is somehow labeled to fill the nnth field, and ignore all other args.
If each argument is also numbered, we just have to match field# to arg#:

f   arg #
i   X| | 
e   -+-+-
l    |X| 
d   -+-+-
#    | |X

Rows are the field number (Rnn)
Columns are the argument number (Cmm)

How does SET expand?
It expands into:

MAYBE(defaultnn, CALL_MACRO_X_FOR_EACH(CONCAT, Rnn, args))

The way MAYBE is written, it effectively happens after CALL_MACRO_X_FOR_EACH.
For now, just know that if we're filling a field that we have an argument for, MAYBE will do nothing at all.
We'll also skim through CALL_MACRO_X_FOR_EACH.
Similarly to how SETnn works as a chain, CALL_MACRO_X_FOR_EACH uses a chain to call CONCAT with first argument Rnn and second argument 1 of args:
/* args = C01(x), C02(y), C03(z) */
CALL_MACRO_X_FOR_EACH(CONCAT, R01, C01(x), C02(y), C03(z))
-> CONCAT(R01, C01(x)) CONCAT(R01, C02(y)) CONCAT(R01, C03(z))

CONCAT concatenates the labels Rnn with each argument:
CONCAT(R01, C01(x)) CONCAT(R01, C02(y)) CONCAT(R01, C03(z))
-> R01C01(x) R01C02(y) R01C03(z)

This is the order-of-n^2 part. Each and every RnnCmm(X) combination is actually a #define.
Only the ones where nn == mm turn into (X), all others turn into nothing.
R01C01(x) R01C02(y) R01C03(z)
-> x


What if no arguments are given that match the field number?
This is where MAYBE comes in, and replaces nothingness:

R01C02(y) R01C03(z)
->

with a default value:
MAYBE(defaultnn, )
-> defaultnn


What if >1 arguments are given for 1 field number?
ie, SET04( C02(x), C02(y) );
This will not work, much like writing int mynum = 5 7; will not work.",True,{}

Can only be obtained by same-race sacrifice on a chaotic altar, while a permanently chaotic knight wielding a long sword. This will convert the long sword into Dirge, rustproofing it, clearing erosion, and setting enchantment to 0 if it was previously lower. This will not uncurse it.
Has +5 to hit and +1d10 acid damage
Has +6 unholy damage when cursed

Grants acid resistance when wielded

chaotic intelligent knight-favoring malleable long sword

Will always evade the grasp of non-chaotics and non-knights, you must be a chaotic knight to wield. Helms of opposite alignment are accepted for wielding purposes.


Can only be obtained by same-race sacrifice on a chaotic altar, while a permanently chaotic knight wielding a long sword. This will convert the long sword into Dirge, rustproofing it, clearing erosion, and setting enchantment to 0 if it was previously lower. This will not uncurse it.
Has +5 to hit and +1d10 acid damage
Has +6 unholy damage when cursed
Permanently coated in acid poison
Grants acid resistance when wielded

This is mostly just a feature suggestion I wanted to get out there. It seems like fun, if not particularly balanced, and shouldn't be too busted since it requires a permanent conversion to chaotic to get. Should be only marginally stronger than Excalibur in general, and much less useful in the late game considering the extra d10 acid vs 3d7 holy. Thoughts?","Could give it the self-acidifying property instead of a permanent coat of acid poison.  Self-acidifying means that the first few hits of every fight have the extra acid damage, then it drops back to +1d10 only.
Edit: Is that acid AND poison coatings, or just an acid coating?
Edit 2: Note that Excal is... 5.5 physical + 10.5 holy for +16 basic, while this version of dirge is 5.5 acid + 5.5 acid + 6 unholy, for +17 basic, so a permanent acid coating is not unbalanced. The player also spends more of the game fighting holy-hating monsters than they do fighting unholy-hating monsters.",True,{}

Poison is definitely a nerf for endgame damage, but does have the instakill vs some foes. I also considered filth, but that's stupid as a permanent due to the instakill chance.
Yeah, the average damage is supposed to be equal to or possibly a tad lower than excalibur. It may need to go lower still, considering this can be drooled on, but I'm not sure yet.",True,{}

Summoners are prevented from doing more summons once they have their HD-worth of summons active on the field.
Demon-gating is back in, but following summoning rules. Kill the original, and they all go poof; and each one has a limit (of its HD) on how many (and strength of) enemies it can bring out.",True,{}

	croom = &rooms[a]; // current room
	troom = &rooms[b]; // target room
The next block picks based on the relative locations of current and target rooms. I'll just pull apart the first if:
	if(troom->lx > croom->hx) { // target room is fully to the right of current room
		dx = 1; // corridor traveling to the right
		dy = 0; // non vertical
		xx = croom->hx+1; // column on the right wall of current room
		tx = troom->lx-1; // column on the left wall of target room
		finddpos(&cc, xx, croom->ly, xx, croom->hy); // find a position 'cc' in the right wall of current room
		finddpos(&tt, tx, troom->ly, tx, troom->hy); // find a position 'tt' in the left wall of target room
	}
Then we set variables
	xx = cc.x; // door position on current room
	yy = cc.y;
	tx = tt.x - dx; // square directly in front of wall on target room
	ty = tt.y - dy;
And we get our first instance of nxcor!
	if(nxcor && levl[xx+dx][yy+dy].typ) // if the square directly in front of the wall in our current room is anything but stone
		return; // end early, join() did nothing
I'll skip the shared-wall-door-making, as that's not vanilla.
Our second use of nxcor...
	// on wall of current room
	if (okdoor(xx,yy) || !nxcor) // if it's an ok place for a door, or !nxcor
	    dodoor(xx,yy,croom); // make the door here
Dig a corridor, return early if it fails... nxcor here allows the corridor to fail 'for no reason' partway through.
	org.x  = xx+dx; org.y  = yy+dy;
	dest.x = tx; dest.y = ty;

	if (!dig_corridor(&org, &dest, nxcor,
			level.flags.arboreal ? ROOM : CORR, STONE))
	    return;
And our final use of nxcor:
	// on wall of target room
	if (okdoor(tt.x, tt.y) || !nxcor) // if it's an ok place for a door, or !nxcor
	    dodoor(tt.x, tt.y, troom); // make the door here
Huh.
Now where can these target locations be? [xx,yy] was determined earlier by finddpos():
finddpos(cc, xl,yl,xh,yh)
coord *cc;
xchar xl,yl,xh,yh;
{
	register xchar x, y;

	x = (xl == xh) ? xl : (xl + rn2(xh-xl+1));
	y = (yl == yh) ? yl : (yl + rn2(yh-yl+1));
	if(okdoor(x, y))
		goto gotit;

	for(x = xl; x <= xh; x++) for(y = yl; y <= yh; y++)
		if(okdoor(x, y))
			goto gotit;

	for(x = xl; x <= xh; x++) for(y = yl; y <= yh; y++)
		if(IS_DOOR(levl[x][y].typ) || levl[x][y].typ == SDOOR)
			goto gotit;
	/* cannot find something reasonable -- strange */
	x = xl;
	y = yh;
gotit:
	cc->x = x;
	cc->y = y;
	return;
}
Which can ONLY get coordinates of okdoor() or DOOR or SDOOR (or the bottom left corner, which we don't see happening).
Therefore, all that the !nxcor is doing is allowing us to add doors on top of doors. Which is dumb. Vanilla doesn't run into the maxdoors issue because I amped up roomcount in dnh levelgen, so it makes many more attempts to join() rooms and can create doors on top of doors like this enough times to reach MAXDOOR.",True,{}

Shadowblades (edderkops et. al.) always hit insubstantial targets

Soulblades (elocators) hit insubstantial targets if they have a mind
Blades of mercury (unused) never hit insubstantial targets (currently unused in practice, message handling existed, but unclear what the proper criteria are)
Water-jet blades (Uiscerre Eladrin) hit insubstantial targets if they are vulnerable to water damage, i.e. flaming or made of iron
Blades of fire (Fierna) hit insubstantial targets if they're not immune to fire damage, which includes monster innate resistances, standing on a Sigil of Cthugha, having Fafnir bound, and being a half-dragon with fire breath
Blades of poison (Naome) hit insubstantial targest if they're not poison resistant
