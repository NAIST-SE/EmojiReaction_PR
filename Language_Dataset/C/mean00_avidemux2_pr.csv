If there is an accel key conflict in the French locale, it should be resolved in avidemux_fr.ts.

A few notes:

Translations marked as obsolete have no effect, it is a waste of time to correct them.
Many English strings have keyboard accelerators, you don't provide any equivalents for cyrillic layout. Why? Keyboard accessibility is awesome.
When translating strings containing markup (even wrong one like &lt;b&gt;Video Decoder&lt;b&gt; which should be fixed shortly before the .ts files get regenerated next time, it has been forgotten recently) please preserve the markup.
When translating (0 track(s)) as (0 дорожка/-ек), the lenght of the string grows from 15 to 18 characters. This may result in increased width of the codec widget, pushing the right edge of the video out of sight (maybe this issue will get properly fixed later, but this is what the things look like now). I'd suggest dropping leading spaces to reduce the string length.",True,{}

apply your patch to the branch, make any corrections you like. Once you are all set, push the branch to your GitHub repository and open a new pull request from that branch. It means, never work on master, always on a branch.

Description / Actual Key / display shortcut

I fear I don't quite get the idea. Would you prefer making every single shortcut a pref? Or every alternative shortcut a pref? Prefs expect value pairs (like Action:shortCut, so this is OK). There is no GUI to set them yet, encouraging users to edit config3 manually is probably the easiest way to get into trouble. Only a small subset of shortcuts raises a controversy, this is why I wanted to avoid to touch the MenuEntry struct and myMenu{Edit,Go} vectors.
My immediate goal was to produce a cheap stop-gap solution (i.e. something still doable with my limited skills) to address usability issues with laptop keyboards. Qt allows to assign multiple shortcuts to an action, which I investigated and got basically working, but backed off from that path because of poor discoverability of secondary shortcuts.

Will this take care of bringing back [ and ] ?

If we end up with user configurable keyboard shortcuts, you'll be able to assign these keys (which are horribly inconvenient on non-US keyboards and completely absent in some Russian layouts). The current patch suggests I and O for that.",True,{}

The default keys stays the same, but you can set an alternate shortcut, which is as below by default
and that you can reset
That way, even if you have US/russian/German keyboard and using desktop/laptop keyboard
everybody can tune it as it pleases
The pref would be a int, -1 would mean default, else the key to use
It's just that there will always be someone with a special keyboard/language that will be unhappy if not done that way
That would end up as
ACT_PREF_ALT_MARKA = 'I'
ACT_PREF_ALT_MARKB = -1 (default)
etc etc

The comments in the ADM_socket::createBindAndAccept() routine suggest
that the value for the port should be 0 when calling bind(). This change
ensures that.
Note: I tested this change on the 2.7.0 release and then went over to
github to hand-edit the trivial change in. I am not fully sure about the
intent of using the provided value of *port at all (even in the log message

No problem with marking existing translations as unfinished, but you have removed a lot of seemingly valid translations like those I quoted above (e.g. ""Width"" --> ""Szerokość"", ""Height"" --> ""Wysokość"" in the MPlayer Delogo plugin). Was it intentional or by accident? If translations are not completely misleading or otherwise wrong, I would suggest keeping them until they are replaced with a better alternative.

Regarding qtbase translations, it would be better to submit patches where these files come from – https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qttranslations.git/ –  following https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Localization because any modifications to these files in the Avidemux codebase will be overwritten when the translations get refreshed (copied over from upstream).

The width of 720 includes overscan.  The displayed width, the part of the screen which should make up the 4:3 or 16:9 image, is only ~704 of those pixels.
This can been seen in the H263, H264, and H265 specs, where the PAR 12:11 example is 720x576 with overscan, and the 24:12 example is the 352x576 without overscan.
The analog outputs of DVD players would almost always get this correct, with 704 and 720 width DVDs having the same PAR and 720 width DVDs having effectively 16 pixel wider image.
Digital display of DVDs was quite often wrong, treating the 720 width image as having no overscan and producing the incorrect 16:15 and 64:45 PARs.
If the source was originally analog video, then 16:15 is almost certainly wrong and 12:11 is correct.

The minimum amount of memory necessary to store a 3840x2160 YUV picture with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling is 3840 * 2160 * 3 / 2 = 12441600 bytes.
With hardware acceleration enabled, 12441600 * 60 ≅ 712 MiB which the graphics card needs to be able to allocate in its memory available for video decoding acceleration (maybe it can use the entire graphics memory and swap into the main one, I don't know, this may depend on hardware, operating system, driver and driver settings).
With editor cache size at maximum, a graphics card needs to be able to provide almost 3 GiB of video decode acceleration memory.
Fianlly, we should not forget that this is per loaded video, i.e. appending a second video doubles the requirements.
How should this scale? My experience with hitting the ceiling of available video surfaces was not good so far. Actually, the current number of 16 pictures in cache is already pretty dangerous in absence of a safe and reliable way to detect the actual limit for the particular system (we should not forget that other applications may want to allocate some video surfaces as well).",True,{}

I understand that this allows to re-position the rubber band without disengaging the aspect ratio lock, but I don't like the UX, namely:

the bottom-right grip jumps away when dragged
spinboxes get out of sync with the rubber band
swapping checkbox description with a tooltip-style comment resizes the dialog when video width is small

The effect of adaptive strength when disabled being identical when set to maximum is utterly confusing IMHO. Are you sure it is not a bug in Avidemux implementation? If not, I am really inclined to trick (i.e. allow 0 as parameter value, but internally translate it to a very small non-zero value depending on toggle state).
I feel that the state of toggles needs to be preserved across sessions, i.e. the set of parameters in asharp struct needs to be extended.

Actually it is not the same. When disabled, and threshold set to max, the macroblock and submacroblock boundaries can be seen (depending on the source), with enabled & max value they not. In the disabled case it is pure unsharp masking. When enbaled and set to max, it will still be adaptive.

I think its bad UX if you move the slider just a litle bit, and the result is drastically different. The spearate checkbox for enable/disable is more clean.

I agree, the blame falls onto the developers of the original filter implementation, IMHO not suitable 1:1 for a GUI. This is why I would cheat here, keeping the checkbox and allowing zero in the spinbox, which will be translated to a very small non-zero value behind the curtains.
The checkbox will ensure that zero is passed to the algorithm when checked.

A feature to grab the rubber rectangle at any position outside the grips and drag it around would be indeed cool. You could probably subclass ADM_rubberControl and use mouse events.

I wonder whether it is necessary to printString() ""Processed"" as there is no side-by-side comparison and therefore the picture must show the preview of output. This costs a little bit of performance, isn't it?
There is a usability problem with horizontalSliderUnSync: because of its huge range, it is difficult to use with mouse wheel, you have to scroll and scroll and scroll... and it hardly moves from the spot. It would be great to have this fixed.
I would suggest a distinct description for each checkbox (e.g. ""No luma delay"", ""No chroma delay""). My first thought was a copy&paste error until I read the code.

Got it, thanks. I really hope that it can be made at least twice as fast as it is now.

So VA-API is a hw decelerator? :)

As long as hw surfaces don't need to be converted to regular images with deinterleaved chroma, VA-API is great. Even going the opposite way (YV12 --> NV12) is pretty fast. But NV12 --> YV12 is an unmitigated disaster.

¯_(ツ)_/¯","Thank you, amazing, but the code actually works, albeit it doesn't speed up things, unfortunately.
(I tried it first by using the dummy video filter modified to do a roundtrip YV12 --> NV12 --> YV12)
Here I owe you an apology as I forgot that I had changed admLibVA::surfaceToAdmImage myself to do the NV12 --> YV12 conversion not by convertFromNV12() I pointed to but by libswscale. The slow operation reflects the performance of libswscale while convertFromNV12() is even much slower on my hardware (but not on an i7 as I heard), I get hardly 60fps for 720p source when using the internal function. Unfortunately, the patch doesn't make it faster.
What puzzles me, my old main PC was more than 2x faster in the roundtrip test with the same 720p source than the i3 machine with admLibVA::surfaceToAdmImage rewired to convertFromNV12().

Actually, the size of all QGraphicsView widgets is completely wrong unless the dialog is resized manually, not just the canvas. The problem disappears when scale(0.5, 0.5) calls are removed. Unsure what is going on here either.

No, and also unnecessary, was a stupid late night idea.

 /**

fixes the crash for you?
Deleting previewDialog in right in filtermainWindow::closePreview instead of later during the next call of filtermainWindow::preview works great on Linux but results almost always in a segfault in Qt on macOS (like a race condition somewhere in QtCore).

when resize involved in the filter chain, and the closed (but not deleted) preview had different width/height registered, then the actual w/h changed because of the resizer.

Sorry :)  So, if there is a resizer instantiated amongst the filters, and (after the ""closed preview"") it is moved up/down, or the resized dimensions are changed, it will lead to crash (and i suspected it happens because the preview want to read a different sized ADM_Image, that is actually provided to it.)

Disable a filter
Preview the output of the remaining items of the chain
Re-enable the filter

As the design goal is to preserve filter configuration, is this cycle guaranteed to be non-destructive? Can the step 2 alter the configuration of remaining active filters?

Sure, but in case of the selected disabled filter being the last in the chain, this introduces a discrepancy between the preview in the filter manager (which includes the disabled filter) and the preview in the main window (which excludes it). Both behave correctly in their own right, but the result feels inherently buggy for me.

Did you mean 3. Re-enable the filter?

No, I meant step 2, but I was partially wrong.
Many filters don't validate configuration during contruction phase, preview is safe for them. But quite a few filters validate configuration when the configuration dialog is opened. Replace Step 2 with ""Configure a filter farther down in the filter chain"" and this step may become destructive.

Load a 1280x720 video with a logo in the top left corner
Rotate it to 270° (this moves the logo to the bottom left corner)
Add mpdelogo2, configure it to remove the logo in the bottom left corner
Preview the final result
Disable rotate
Open mpdelogo2 configuration dialog, accept it.
Re-enable rotate
Preview the final result

Actual results: the picture at step 4 and at 8 is not the same.
This is nothing new as moving filters around can have the same effect, but this points to what I perceive to be the real issue which needs a solution (with the premise behind the feature to allow to disable active filters taking at symptoms): it would be great to have a proper undo/redo functionality for the filter chain similar to segment layout in the editor. This would naturally provide the feature to disable a filter by simply deleting it as this step will be immediately reversible.

This is sort of expected when filters up the chain are reconfigured, but disabling and re-enabling suggests non-destructive, fully reversible operation, a promise it cannot keep.

The undo/redo functionality would be great, but it is beyond my skill level.

Your skill level is formidable. In a very rough draft of undo/redo functionality, we would probably need a memento in form of a container with items consisting of filter tag (uint32_t) and CONFcouple array for each filter in the chain. Adding/deleting a filter or altering filter configuration would create a new memento and push it onto undo stack. undo() would create another memento and push it onto redo stack, then recreate filter chain from the memento popped from the undo stack. redo() would mirror this procedure. We would need two actions connected to undo and redo buttons with appropriate keyboard shortcuts.

An example workflow where i would like this disable option (and undo/redo would'nt work):
There are frequent camera switching in a video, one camera angle is dark, the other not so much. Also i want cropping, then fit to (a common) size. I save the segments with a mezzanine encoder, then at the end i append them then encode with the final codec.

With a disable option i can use two exclusive crop filter, where only minor adjustment would needed, and i could keep the color filters for each scenario.

This scenario is indeed much more complex than anything I could imagine. The enable/disable option would serve as a replacement for missing preset functionality then (both are not mutually exclusive).

The preview in the filter manager does not show the complete chain output, but the selected filter's.

It shows the output of the chain up to and including the selected filter (by default the last one). Actually, I figured this out a few years ago as a big surprise by reading code. I guess that adding the name of the selected filter to the window title would improve discoverability.
However, the new implementation creates IMHO a confusing element of not showing the actual output of the filter chain by default if the last filter is disabled (and it would never show the actual output if all active filters are disabled). Unsure how to solve this. Maybe by making the button always preview the final output, with preview of filters higher up in the chain available only via context menu? Could be perceived as a regression, I fear.",True,{}

Indeed, no reason to worry as createVideoFilterChain() will always ensure the bridge is setup properly.

I try to rephrase the problem: the filter takes the first frame of the specified time window, when the play/saving process enter into the window. Then it will use this picture for blending. The issue only emerges, when the user seek in the preview of the filter chain.
During a linear process (eg. transcoding) it will work fine, even with the existing code.
I dont see another solution. If somehow you manage it to jump to the fist frame of the time window to take the frame, it will break the filter chain.

Sure, as libavcodec + libavutil keep decoded pictures needed for reference in refcounted buffers.
When hw accel is used, these buffers are hw surfaces pointed to by refHwImage in refDescriptor member of ADMImage in cacheElem. We manage these hw surfaces ourselves and set get_buffer2 callback in AVCodecContext to the pointer to our allocator and the free callback in av_buffer_create to our function to free a surface.

Indeed, thanks, the crash is gone. I don't quite understand why it works yet.
Avidemux was really not using a per-video cache to its potential, I mean it should be possible at least to retain decoded images before a segment switch when the next segment has a different ref video, so that stepping backward across such segment boundaries could be faster.
If we go with a single common cache, what is the purpose of keeping different cache instances per video? Just to store int myInstance? Wouldn't it be more straightforward to move the cache into ADM_EditorSegment and do without any static vars? It makes a slightly bigger patch as the interface needs to be modified, but IMVHO this looks clearer.

I'm not 100% sure, but i think the problem was, hw ADM_images were reused without proper cleaning/releasing.

I mean it should be possible at least to retain decoded images before a segment switch when the next segment has a different ref video, so that stepping backward across such segment boundaries could be faster.

IMHO it is diminishing return. What would be really nice, if it could retain between segments in the same ref video.

I'm not an expert in object oriented programming (i only started using oop and c++ back in january, to improve the usability of this software), but i think this way follows the encapsulation principle  more strictly. And if it turns out to be problematic, reverting is easier.

This is pretty amazing.

And if it turns out to be problematic, reverting is easier.

my ulterior motive here is to make way a possible increase in EDITOR_CACHE_MAX_SIZE, and consequently to the increase of the upper limit of the editor cache size preference :-)

I fear I have to (partially) disappoint you as the main obstacle – limited hw resources when a hw decoder is used – is not alleviated by sharing a cache, e.g. with VDPAU, we still have to allocate at least cache_size + nb_ref_frames surfaces per decoder instance, i.e. per video. I don't know yet whether we can safely destroy some surfaces (currently we destroy them later when the decoder instance has been deleted) .

Caching matters mostly when using sw decoders. Would it be possible that cache size preference is used only when hw acceleration disabled? HW decoders are pretty fast, and can go with small cache size, so it could be even a hard define.
The optimal cache size would be to fit an entire GOP, but obviously that not realistic. But the current upper limit is too small.

While technically possible, wouldn't it be an awfully awkward design? Especially considering that enabling hw accelerated decoding doesn't mean that a particular video can be decoded in hardware. This would also motivate users to keep hw decoding disabled, which is a bad thing.

Did you select the right soundcard with the F6 key? Did you try a live system with more recent kernel?
I just realized that when I select an Alsa* output in Avidemux, Avidemux controls the master volume for all applications. I am not sure whether it is a desired behavior or a fixworthy bug. Probably the latter or an artifact of PulseAudio emulation, the volume control for the CoreAudio output on macOS affects the volume level for Avidemux only, similar to this soft volume solution for PAS (which works great).

I played with making them thicker quite a long time ago and discarded such attempts for visual reasons (probably personal taste issues). The bars must be twice as thick pixel-wise in HiDPI conditions. If they are not, this needs to be fixed.

but it is possibly not the main issue.

Indeed. The VU meter is a terrible resource hog. On macOS, it consumes more CPU power than decoding 720p@25fps H.264 in software. This was the reason I extended the effect of refresh cap setting to the VU meter, which rendered this widget even less useful.

This is very valid. As long as window size follows zoom level instead of adding scroll bars, we get all sorts of inconsistent and confusing behaviour.

widget visibility is restored as expected, but in the View Menu / Toolbars the checkboxes are always checked after start.

Could you please share the code? We might do something Qt doesn't expect. It can be also a Qt bug, in which case it would be interesting to see whether it persists with Qt6.

Well, i have scrapped those changes, but it wasnt very complicated:
For loading:
QSettings* settings = new QSettings(QDir::currentPath() + ""/my_config_file.ini"", QSettings::IniFormat); restoreGeometry(settings->value(""geometry"").toByteArray()); restoreState(settings->value(""windowState"").toByteArray());
For saving:
QSettings* settings = new QSettings(QDir::currentPath() + ""/my_config_file.ini"", QSettings::IniFormat); settings->setValue(""geometry"", saveGeometry()); settings->setValue(""windowState"", saveState()); settings->sync();

However, if i launch adm next time, i would expect it to show the rubber band.

I struggle to understand why rubber band visibility in the crop filter should be different (should be reset) after application restart (even if it would be trivial to implement it). However, there is indeed a problem of the rubber band visibility being merely a usage hint in some filters (crop, blackenBorder) and an essential functionality in others (blur, mplayerDelogo). This means there is probably no ""one size fits all"" solution.
I've pushed two experimental commits to use QSettings for rubber band visibility in crop and blackenBorder, thus opening the Pandora's Box of inconsistency. I might revert both, haven't made my mind yet.

There are already displays with 360 Hz refresh rate, so you can think of this limit as future proofing.

This. Absolutely. For some reason, this condition was true only once, at the very first resize event, creating the bug.
I think, avoiding wasteful reallocation of memory can be solved separately.
I have checked devicePixelRatioF() in a MinGW build on Windows 10 with a few debug messages added, it always returns the expected, correct value, so that idea is moot.

That would be a bad idea. On the one hand the mutex is not unused, it is the sole guard that provides the in-order execution of actions; on the other this would discard every action while the sole one is serviced. The NAVIGATION_ACTION_LOCK_THRESHOLD makes possibble to queue a limited number of action (for example if i want to go forward 3 frames, and i press right arrow key three times, using the mutex it could discard 2 keypress).

rgbColorBlend in fadeThrough struct is not changing, no? For the case of range changing on-the-fly, we would need to pre-calculate two sets of coefficients, this is true.

Should be fixed

When previewing the filter in the main window, audio is strongly out of sync (delayed!) after the end of filter scope. Audio being ahead of video is easily possible with slow filters, but getting behind is probably a bug.

I tried the scenario with more than one video. Here works as expected, after the scope the audio is in sync with the video.

When starting preview in the main window from a point within the range, the filter seems to determine the range from relative time rather than absolute. Unsure, though. Something is not right here.

I think it is, due to not gettting a call to goToTime, which would invalidate the filter. IDK if this could be fixed at all.

Preview after seek into the range in the filter manager which is acknowledged as not working, would be nice to have.

I dont think it would be possible.

I wonder whether the cache file location and name could be made user-defined.

No wonder, I am the culprit: c598494
Last night, I could test a little on Linux. Reflagging dialog window as a normal window results in a very weird behaviour of gnome-shell 3.38.5 / mutter: such a filter preview window can be moved to another workspace, but switching workspaces back becomes impossible(?!) unless preview is closed. Will test with the current gnome-shell and Qt6 later.
Definitely not going the path of adding a preference, QSetting would be fine because filter-specific, but the problem are window flags and how Qt and window managers handle this, else I would suggest the private patch below (GitHub doesn't accept .patch, great, thus renamed to .patch.txt).

I don't think the feature is significant enough to justify introduction of broken behaviour* which unfortunately ensues at least with gnome-shell, the current version included, when moving modal windows not flagged as a dialog to a different workspace.
*) It is impossible to switch to the workspace containing Avidemux main window once filter preview has been moved to a different workspace as long as the filter preview remains open on a different workspace.

Then Qsetting could could restore size if pref set to Qt::window.

I haven't found a way to restore the parent widget size / window geometry from ADM_flyDialog, that turned out to be tricky. Restoring window state was easy.
By the way, the part of qtRegisterDialog which should ensure that all windows are open as dialogs is buggy, it should have been

harmonize behaviour with regular saving.

I think that a user who wants to queue a job doesn't expect to see the usual file dialog. My first reaction would be to cancel the dialog and to double-check that I didn't select a wrong menu action.

The same happens on a switch from light to dark, just that the barely visible text is dark on dark. The text in the time indicator has wrong color too.
Restarting Avidemux rectifies that.

Much closer to what feels ""right"" with my hardware (which is how it looks when samples are played by mpv with --vo=gpu). I do see some green tint with non-clipping RGB adaptive modes for the ""The World in HDR"" 10-bit AV1 sample. With all samples, the clipping mode is the one which produces the best – really perfect looking – results, except in areas where actual clipping occurs. With other RGB adaptive modes, I need to apply a lot of boost (at least 1.8 with Reinhard, 2 with Hable), even after reducing target luminance to values below 40.

This is a known fact. Clipping is the best to preserves colors, others not.
the ""hue and saturation shifts"" (really mostly saturation shifts) resulting from applying nonlinear curves per channel are an important feature, not a bug.
Otherwise there is still something wrong with the colors, but have not figured out why.

With other RGB adaptive modes, I need to apply a lot of boost (at least 1.8 with Reinhard, 2 with Hable), even after reducing target luminance to values below 40.

With my samples those boost values are too much, so there is no good setting, the final adjusments have to be made by the user. The adaptivity really just means, that try to be reasonably good simultaneously at brigth and dark scenes. Target luminance probably has little effect.
