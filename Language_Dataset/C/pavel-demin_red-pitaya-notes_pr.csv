the IC2 code is running.
I have a problem with the script to generate the linux system. The
compiler is missing openssl/evp.h at tools/aisimage.c.
But the bit file and the sdr-transceiver-hpsdr is compiling.

I've again modified the I2C code. The latest version is now in the master branch:

A new version (0.94-1058) of the Red Pitaya SDR application compatible with HPSDR is now available via the Red Pitaya application market place. I've also updated the customized SD card image.
Could you please check if this new version works with your I2C board?
I've also added some information about the I2C interface to my notes:

I have a couple of comments/suggestions:

I've just done some reading about comments in the Python code and discovered that it's normally not recommended to use string literals as comments. The main arguments are that it's not standard and that there could be some side effects. So, could you please replace the string literals with # prefixed comments?
I think that the python sub-directory is one sub-directory too much :-) I'd prefer to keep all the clients in one directory called clients. If, one day, there are too many clients in this directory, then we'll move it to a separate GitHub repository.
I think that it would be better to keep TX and RX clients in separate files.",True,{}

The link from my previous comment is the latest Linux version provided by Xilinx:
https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx/blob/xilinx-v2016.4/fs/binfmt_script.c#L57
Basically, it's exactly the Linux version running on Red Pitaya.

bash on ubuntu isn't parsing the script as proper bash and not allowing things like arithmetic in for loops correctly with the space

Then this isn't the problem of the extra spaces but of the interpreter command. The patch should replace #! /bin/sh with #! /bin/bash.
I've just tested that bash arithmetic in for loops works with #! /bin/bash and with #!/bin/bash but it doesn't work with #! /bin/sh nor with #!/bin/sh. Here is my test script:
#! /bin/bash

for i in {1..3}
do
   for j in {1..3}
   do
       echo ""scale = 3; sqrt($i*$i + $j*$j)"" | bc
   done

If you want to add PPS input to multiple applications, then I'd think about the following:

maybe use the same address for the reset signal in all the applications (for example 0x40040000)
maybe use the same address for the FIFO reader in all the applications (for example 0x40041000)
