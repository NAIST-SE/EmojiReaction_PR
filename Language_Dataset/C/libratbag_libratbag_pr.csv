All the MIPSen currently, and ARMv7 (although there's a patch for that) ...

but still needs access to gaming mice?

... and from a strictly user-based point of view, none of them need access to
gaming mice (one could argue about mips64el but no). I'm looking at this from
a package maintainer's perspective though, in Debian — and we try to build
everything on all our platforms.

plus, valgrind is only used for the tests anyway (and they're mostly
broken/insufficient right now)

I know, but I like to run upstream tests during builds, it helps shake bugs
out...
I don't mind carrying this in Debian only, I thought it good form to submit
the patch upstream but I know that means pushing the burden on you. There are
other ways of working around the issue but IMO they make the builds more
annoying (especially for local builds — I don't like having a build which
behaves differently depending on what's installed, and build-conflicts end up
being annoying).

Nah. logitech-hid would also match HID++ which uses HID too. Just keep g300, we'll add support for g600 in it, and see how it goes for other devices if there is a need. People just need to know that G600 and G300 are somewhat equivalent.

After reading this, I believe you might be mixing up the mice models and buttons:

the G700, G900 and the G502 in this PR have all a mechanical switch below the wheel that enable/disable the ratchet mode on the wheel. When ratchet is disabled, the wheel is in the ""free wheel"" mode, where it just doesn't have any click (and a lot of inertia).
all buttons on the Logitech devices I have are addressable and can be remapped in libratbag.

So IMO, the ratchet mode buttons that are just mechanical should just be grayed out in the SVG and nothing should mention it.
Also, there is one thing we need to do on the SVG (no need to ask jimmac for that), is that all the Logitech devices can't remap the vertical wheel events. So there are a couple of leaders/buttons on the drawings that need to be removed (and we need to rearrange the other leaders).",True,{}

I have a few remarks regarding the instructions:

Looks good!


There is no size for the image but margins and spacing are given in pixels. Different images will be scaled differently resulting in different margins, spacing, border size, ...


Right, good point. Up until now we haven't cared about size too much, since it's unlikely that a user will have two devices to notice the window resizing when (s)he switches device in Piper. Let's add a minimum of 400*400 and a maximum of 500*500.


The two main buttons on the G500 and G700 do not have separate pieces, so there is no corresponding object. Mouse wheel tilt is not drawn either. Is the ""buttonX"" id mandatory for every button? What should be done for this kind of buttons.


Mouse wheel tilt should be drawn in the latest G502 and G700; it's the little arrows pointing left and right. Copy those and place the marker squares somewhere close to it, and give the arrows the button ids.
The button id is mandatory insofar that without it, the button cannot be highlighted (like this). I agree with @whot in that you can just create an object that overlaps with part of the button (e.g. the top) so it's clear what element is being configured. This also has to be done for the G700 SVG still.",True,{}

Good point. I tried to run the daemon and see if ratbagctl was picking up the service, but unfortunatelly, circle-ci doesn't allow systemd to run within the container.

The arrows next to the scroll wheel that indicate tilting are not recognized as buttons. Please treat the arrows as buttons, with the identifier and paths and everything.
There seem to be two buttons to the left of button 1, but they aren't mapped to anything in Piper (see the screenshot). Is this intentional or an oversight?

They should be there, I could have made some mistake but is weird that it would be exactly with the last four buttons. Isn't it a problem from your prototype that would make it stop after the first six buttons (like using it with a 6 button mouse instead of using a real G500).

Or we have a boolean property of ""IsDefault"" that changes, that way we get to use the PropertyChanged signals as they happen anyway, without the need for extra signals on our behalf. Certainly easier to implement in ratbagd and means we send only two signals whenever the resolution changes (active off and active on).

I don't know, this is probably something we have to implement one way and see if it makes sense, sorry.",True,{}

(We should probably do this for other signals too.)","I'm not sure which approach I like best.
The latter would mean that each class in Piper that has a Ratbagd* instance (let's say a RatbagdResolution in this example) needs to connect to that instance's notify::is-default signal that is emitted whenever this property changes (automatically, by GObject). This is straightforward, but I'm not sure how well it will work with profile switches.
The former would mean that each class in Piper that has a Ratbagd* instance needs a reference to a profile, so that it can connect to the profile's default-resolution-changed signal (again, just taking the RatbagdResolution example here) and do the work from that callback. This will likely work better with profile switches, albeit being a little less straightforward.
I'm not yet sure which of these will work best once I will implement profile switching: there won't be just one profile to work with but all of them, and the active one can change at any given time. In this case, it is likely that every class in Piper needs a reference to a profile anyway, which will change depending on the active-profile-changed signal emitted from RatbagdDevice (currently RatbagdProfile, but this will have to be changed to prevent the same issue we're having now with RatbagdResolution) to grab, for example, the new profile's resolution to update.
Maybe we should postpone this until I get to implementing profiles so I can experiment a bit and see which approach is best.",True,{}

Nah. I think we should consider the daemon state as being the correct one. If a client forgets to call commit(), we should not have a different state for other clients. This will be race prone and we might end up having too much code for no benefit.
Anyway, if one client forgets to commit, the next one will more likely commit given that we expect clients to actually change the device.

Main item here is support for macros in ratbagd. I'm not 100% sure whether that'll be the final API, but the approach here is an array of tuples of (type, value) for each element in the macro. Macro names are picked by ratbagd. There's the theoretical case of exposing macros as separate objects on dbus but I don't think that's worth doing. DBus would allow for SetMacro(s, a(uu)) where we can set the string as well, may be worth doing, maybe not.
Meanwhile, this will be at least useful, if it works ;)
This pull also removes the remaining string button properties and changes them to enums. The LED type is still left and should be fixed too.",I have used my super powers and pushed the PR. Closing now.,True,{}

That triggers the test failures because button mappings are different between the profiles.
This is when running
sudo ./build/ratbagctl.test TestRatbgagCtlButton.test_button_n_action_set_button, I suspect all other tests have a variant of this issue too.

This allows to get the dbus signals when properties are changed.
I then tried to make TestRatbagCtlProfile test working (it fails at set active profile). It's a requirement for this to pass before other tests are run.

We should update the values before sending the events that they are changed.
And finally, I think the ratbagd.py binding is messing up somewhere as there are no g-object event raised that I can find on property changed on profile set_active, meaning that we are basically never in a situation where the test suite will work.
Just to be clear, with the bindings from this PR, you can see than setting a profile active doesn't deactivate the previous one, leading to a list of _profiles[] where 2 profiles are active.

There are. Any Logitech non gaming device that support redirecting can do that (theoretically). Some, however require the redirection to be handled in software, so we can put whatever we want (and emulate macros).

This is the first step required before we are finally able to write macros on the device.
The ""new"" memory API only allows full sectors to be read/written. This ensures we always write the crc and check for it.
Also, now we better detect if the device is using factory profiles or not (see #280).
I still haven't yet implemented caching for the memory. This will be required for macros and to speed up a little bit the parsing of the device.

I think we should not assert on libratbag errors, but only for dbus like errors, which we already don't check as a matter of fact.

We do check for dbus errors, and return those error values over the bus. Internal (ratbag) errors are now not returned; we always return success and emit the Resync signal on the device in case of errors.
I wasn't sure if I should unref the device where I added it to the structs, as I'm not explicitly ref'ing it anywhere.
Also, this PR currently only changes those functions where we'd return r upon error. It does not, for example, check for errors in ratbagd-led where we didn't do that before either. I can add this if required.",True,{}

Correct

I suppose that removes the current ratbag-command.c,

Yes, it will eventually disappear

but what will happen to ratbagctl and ratbagctl.test?

ratbagctl is the tool that we will ship, it doesn't require root.
ratbagctl.test could be split in one that checks for the libratbag bindings, and one for the dbus bindings. This is beneficial to have a tool that allows to remove the man in the middle.

Unless you'll deprecate ratbagctl in favor of this new ratbag-command, we'll have two ""user interfaces"" to maintain,

We already have ratbagctl and ratbag-command. And we can not ship this ratbag-command.py for the simple reason that it requires root. So ratbagctl is not soon to be deprecated.

both using similar but slightly different bindings (ratbagd.py and ratbagc.py). I don't think this is where we should want to go. I understand the need for having a tool that you can use to debug with, but in my opinion if we go through with this we should merge ratbagctl into ratbag-command.c.

The problem with ratbagctl with ratbagd is that it gets tricky to attach a debugger to it and to run valgrind because we fork the ratbagd process. And we want to attach the tools on ratbagd, not on the python dbus client. IIRC, @whot tried to circumvent that during GUADEC, and it almost worked until it was finally not possible to do it. This is why we created bug #274.
From your perspective I understand you do not see the point of this ""new"" ratbag-command. But when we are writing the drivers and debugging them, it gets critical to be able to attach the debugging tools.
Last, the layer in ratbagc.py is just a very mechanical file that allows to match ratbagd.py so we can just swap the two of them. Compared to ratbag-command.c, maintaining a thin wrapper which will be mirrored from ratbagd.py will be much less of a pain than maintaining a full C program that have some very creative way of handling command line arguments.
The main focus will still be on ratbagctl, rest is just developer tools.

Actually, I tried this (more or less) yesterday. It is indeed easy enough to generate the .so without requiring the SWIG dependency. The problem lies that once the .so is there, we can hook up to it, but we need to manually declare the types for the conversion between C to Python. Or when we fetch a string, it'll give us the pointer value instead of the actual string.

Should fix #325
Feedback and advice on general structure welcome!","Few comments on the PR:

there is no good way to test this currently as ratbag-command and ratbagd/ratbagctl are not updated
which means I have some unsupported -1 on the G900 that makes the info command of ratbagctl crash on the G900
the G502 always seem to say that the modes are off even though the led is light up
trying to set up something on the g502 returns an error saying that setting the LED is not supported here (did you add a new capability?)
when starting ratbagd, the g502 lights off and on again... while for the G900 we just read the state in the profile, so I wonder why you are forced to use software controlled LED...

Regarding the code itself, there are a few formatting issues here and there. We can pinpoint those shortly before merging once it is fully functional.
If the assumption that you exported new capabilities is correct, then this is not something you should do (I think). The LED interface should stay the same whether or not you are using RGB LED. We should however add a new capability/function to query the numbers of bits we can set for the color.
And regarding the split of the patches, add non-RGB led reading  and add non-RGB led updating should come together in the same patch, and I think the last one should also be squashed with the previous too.
Basically, when you split code to have a smaller commit, you always need to ask 2 questions:

is my code not actually adding dead code?
can my code be bisected?

For the first one, you should make sure that any function is actually called and be reachable (from  a rough look, it seem the led reading and led updating commits are not raising a warning by gcc but nothing sets the capability, so basically there is no way to test this code until the last one)
For the second advice, you should always make sure the code is bisectable. Here, a git bisect will say that the faulty commit will be the last one when this one doesn't do much.
So it is fine to have big commits if there is no other way around it.",True,{}

Feedback and advice on general structure welcome!","I guess there are a few points that were not totally clear, when I say non-RGB LEDs this actually means monochrome LEDs. There is no way at all to control the LED color through feature 0x1300. The LED just gives you a bitfield which indicates what effects it supports (breathing, blinking, etc...).
Also LEDs advertised through 0x1300 do not always support the full range of effects available, currently this is handled by returning a -ENOTSUP when trying to apply an effect to a LED that does not support it.
I've not added a new ratbag capability, I've only added one to the hidpp20_driver_data structure in order to be able to select the correct method to update the led, either 0x1300 or 0x8070. Though your problem might related to the above.
As for the on and off problem at startup, this is because the code sets the software control property at startup causing the LED control to go from FW to SW and a little flicker. I'll fix this by only turning on software control when writing a LED.

There's the breathe extension I just found: https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
That may move the doxygen+xml bit to sphinx directly, but in the end we'll do the same thing anyway.

isn't doc/dbus.rst autogenerated? If so, is it relevant to add it to the commit?

No, it's not. That's the handwritten one. The big problem with the dbus API is that it doesn't exist anywhere but on dbus. It's not like a class or something, it really needs to be hand-written.

I think I'd like to have the circle.yml updated to generate the documentation also in the CI, that would help knowing the dependencies and make sure the whole thing compiles

I can do that easily enough, but fwiw I think the documentation generation + upload will be a manual task, once the DBus API changes we'll likely won't have too many changes here. Anyway, let's see how this goes",True,{}

The reason is that if you happen to have one of these mouse connected to your system, libratbag (or ratbagd) will fail to start given that the assert will be raised.

IIRC the Roccat mouse you have already has such button. The original design simply had both modes attached to each leader. Then the gnome refresh of the designed appeared, and the functionality disappeared.
IMO it's more of a design issue (then piper issue) than a libratbag issue for the moment. For the roccat, IIRC, libratbag exports the number of buttons times the modes (2). So here, I am not so sure what to do with such mode.

Thanks!","I'm not sure that a side view is going to be particularly easier to read, and if I am not mistaken @jimmac advocated against having multiple angles. Keep in mind that the mouse buttons will be highlighted when hovered. I think for now you can maybe exaggerate a little bit by making the buttons slightly larger than they should be scale-wise, so they are even/a little easier to notice.
As for the shift mode -- I haven't seen that before. I'm not sure how I missed that and why no one mentioned it earlier! I'm thinking that Piper can read when the Shift key is pressed and, when it knows that the current mouse supports this, update its UI to reflect the new state. So to configure e.g. Shift + left mouse button, you would press Shift in Piper and then select the button mapping to the left mouse button.
I think this is the most transparent, as there would be no need for another layer in the SVG or for multiple leader lines and double the amount of buttons in the UI. To make this feature discoverable, the SVGs could have a little arrow or something in some corner that is highlighted when Shift is pressed.",True,{}

I'm not sure if that's exactly what you had in mind, but I think it makes the buttons quite a bit more decipherable.

My assumption is that when a button is to be highlighted, its group is brought to the top and the fill/stroke colors changed. If that is indeed what happens, then I think having them overlayed won't be too confusing. Just in case, I also labeled each leader at the button end. Each label is also part of its respective leader group for added highlighting.
The main downside I can see so far is that the overlayed leaders become ""thicker"" looking than the non overlayed ones, because the partially transparent anti-aliasing pixels at the edges of the leader line add up and become darker than they otherwise would be.

Maybe we don't need to expose the library but we should provide a way to make sure libratbag is installed. Also, providing a pkgconfig file, even without a library (I don't know if that's possible but I assume it is), allows build systems to know the path prefix of the libratbag instalation. This, for example, removes the need for hardcoded path lists in projects using libratbag's assets (svg files, etc.).

We probably need to add something like an Error event in the DBus API so that piper can display something useful to the user but this to me feels like we're keeping ratbagd simple and offloading all the error handling into piper.

That piper doesn't check the values and trusts them blindly is a different issue.",True,{}

Added support for changing DPI, polling rate and colors as well as all the color modes (on/off/cycle/breathing). Also added an SVG file (still WIP, nearly complete).
Of course, feedback, criticisms and suggestions are very welcome.
Regarding the driver:
This mouse uses a new DeviceVersion: version 3. It is a frankensteined combo of version 1 and 2. On one hand, the Rival 600 uses the same command codes as mice in version 1; on the other hand, it uses a very similar protocol for colors and effects as version 2 (Rival310 and Sensei310).
Thus, I am piggybacking on steelseries_write_led_v2() for the LED color protocol, because other than the header field indexes they are identical. I modified construct_cycle_buffer() to retrieve field indexes from a struct steelseries_led_cycle_spec, instead of using hard-coded indexes.
I did this in an attempt to reuse code. Should I keep it like that, or should I revert the changes in v2 and have a completely separate v3?
Also, since steelseries_write_led_v2() is modified, could anyone test with a v2 mouse to verify I didn't break anything?","WIP -  do not merge

Added support for changing DPI, polling rate and colors as well as all the color modes (on/off/cycle/breathing). Also added an SVG file (still WIP, nearly complete).

Regarding the driver:
This mouse uses a new DeviceVersion: version 3. It is a frankensteined combo of version 1 and 2. On one hand, the Rival 600 uses the same command codes as mice in version 1; on the other hand, it uses a very similar protocol for colors and effects as version 2 (Rival310 and Sensei310).
Thus, I am piggybacking on steelseries_write_led_v2() for the LED color protocol, because other than the header field indexes they are identical. I modified construct_cycle_buffer() to retrieve field indexes from a struct steelseries_led_cycle_spec, instead of using hard-coded indexes.
I did this in an attempt to reuse code. Should I keep it like that, or should I revert the changes in v2 and have a completely separate v3?
Also, since steelseries_write_led_v2() is modified, could anyone test with a v2 mouse to verify I didn't break anything?","@FFY00 I tried the read commands, however it doesn't seem like it did anything:

This is the easier way of testing commands I've been able to come up with:
Run hexdump /dev/hidraw0 (should be 0 if you don't have any other HID device connected but it might be different on your system) and keep it opened to read from the mouse.
Then you can send a command using something like this https://gist.github.com/FFY00/faa3065a0fd39681143714c6272d90af (again, should be hidraw1 but it might be other device). If the command returns something, you'll see it popping up in hexdump.

I did this in an attempt to reuse code. Should I keep it like that, or should I revert the changes in v2 and have a completely separate v3?

I tried to add support for G Pro Wireless. Basically it worked out of the box (it automatically selected G900) I added an svg file. The only problem is that G900 and G Pro have the same DeviceMatch=usb:046d:c539 and svg file used is still the one for G900 I've removed DeviceMatch from G900 and tested G Pro but I am not sure how to properly solve this. If you have some hints please let me know.
I found some problems with original G Pro commit and fixed them in this commit as well PR #573.

One minor issue is that when the mouse is connected with the cord (it can be used like this as well)  ratbagctl does not find it anymore i.e.

#ratbagctl list
No devices available.

lsusb shows that the device is still present and the mouse works fine.

This is now fixed with the new DeviceMatch.
Very likely the same problem exist for logitech g900 since it also had dual mode (I think).

Nah, don't have the time for this atm. It's a bit tricky now anyway, the Resync signal works nice for piper but not so much for ratbagctl which is supposed to exit immediately.

Which means that we need to either think of adding rw to those as well. We can then also rethink the other capabilities because now:

RATBAG_DEVICE_CAP_CONFIGURATION - still useful as flag for write-only devices (I don't think read-only devices exist, short of missing implementations)
RATBAG_DEVICE_CAP_RESOLUTION - implied if we have resolutions, so only the write bit is useful.
RATBAG_DEVICE_CAP_PROFILE - implied if we have profiles
RATBAG_DEVICE_CAP_BUTTON - implied if we have buttons
RATBAG_DEVICE_CAP_LED - implied if we have leds
RATBAG_DEVICE_CAP_BUTTON_KEY and RATBAG_DEVICE_CAP_BUTTON_MACROS is probably better as button flag

So effectively this leaves us with only one useful capability which is the one that tells us whether we can write to it. And - new feature - maybe a new bit that tells us it's not persistent. But all the other ones are implied, which makes me think this patchset isn't that useful and can be replaced with one that drops all of them.
Doubly so because we should assume that we have full access to a device, so the bits are more to tell us where a device doesn't do what we'd expect (e.g. we have LEDs but we can't write to them).",True,{}

Fixes #628
Matching piper PR: libratbag/piper#305","Long summary from a meeting @bentiss and I had this morning:
The base requirement is that we have some model-specific identifier that allows us to load the right SVG. How we do this is largely up to us. But one thing really matters: we need to separate what libratbag exports from how piper uses it.
One option is to have an opaque string like chinchilla that stays the same for our models. This provides absolutely no information to the client and forces them to have a database to map those strings into device models. libratbag would have to maintain that database too. That string becomes part of the ABI, forever. We need to make sure that the device remains correctly mapped to that string for the lifetime of libratbag.
The second option is to have a semi-opaque string like logitech-g5 or the advertised model name Logitech G5. This provides better information in that it is at least human-identifiable and makes things like SVG file names easy. However, similar restrictions apply, libratbag needs to maintain a database. If a new model gets released with the same name, we now have to revert to hacks like logitech-g5-2019. We already have devices like the G9x and the G502 that need multiple entries, it's unclear what identifier to use. Because it still has to be treated as opaque string in the client, it carries no more information than chinchilla.
The third option is to have a model identifier in the form of bustype:vid:pid:version. This removes the need for a database on libratbag because we just forward the information from the device. It provides extra information (want to handle BT devices only? skip anything not starting in bluetooth). Likewise if you only want to handle devices from one specific vendor. Plus, if this fails we can blame the vendor instead of us :)
Biggest drawback here is that it's not as human-friendly on the other side. So it'll still require some database to map usb... to logitech-foo.svg but given the drawbacks of the other two approaches, this is just something we have to live with.
Notable changes over the patchset originally submitted:
@bentiss and I agreed that instead of the patchset's (bus, vid, pid) tuple making this a defined string is more flexible. So we define usb:... and bluetooth:..., in the future we may have a ble:... format that is completely different (no VID/PID?)
The version field (was not in the first patchset) means we have an escape where devices re-use VID/PID, we can just bump the version for those.",True,{}

Because it still has to be treated as opaque string in the client, it carries no more information than chinchilla.

A few more arguments against this:

this string would be written by a human, which means it will be error prone. And if we start shipping a device with a bad copy/paste from one file to one other, 2 different mice will have the same product string and we will be screwed. We could partially solve that by adding a check in meson, but that would be extra work
the second extra issue is that it would force libratbag to take the decision on splitting the device based on an assumption on how it will be used. For example, the MX Master can be connected over LUR or bluetooth (and maybe directly from the USB cable). Either libratbag splits this device in 3 which would duplicate the files for no reasons (and will be error prone), either we keep only one device file, but then piper can't take the decision of showing a different SVG if the mouse is wired or not.

Which is why, for all of these reasons, @whot convinced me that we better have a uniquely generated ID, that ratbagd can guarantee its uniqueness and if it's not unique, then we can blame the hardware maker (or the driver).",True,{}

I'm working on adding support for Roccat Kone Pure, specifically Optical Black/White Edition. Before I proceed further I would like some advice in a few areas.
Generally I wanted to take this approach:

Change roccat driver so it can handle both Kone XTD and Kone Pure (is there anyone that can validate my changes using XTD?).
Migrate the driver to new structure with commit() function.
Add support for additional features already supported by ratbag (e.g. LEDs, as I have a working prototype already).

The draft pull request visualizes changes that I needed to make to handle Kone Pure mouse. On one hand it borks existing support for Kone XTD. On the other hand it shows how both these mice differ.


My first question is how to tell the driver which mouse model he needs to communicate with. I saw two examples in the existing codebase - the steelseries driver uses DeviceVersion property (1, 2, 3...) and the hidpp10 driver uses ProfileType property (e.g. G700). I'm not sure why there are already have two different properties already. Unfortunately I would prefer a property named DeviceModel as ProfileType is confusing due to the primary meaning of profiles as a set of configuration values. Thoughts?


Some differences between Pure and XTD could be described in the device files, e.g. DpiRange (100:5000@50 vs 200:8200@50), maybe number of buttons as well.


More serious are remaining differences, namely a) different data structures (USB HID GET/SET_REPORT) and button mappings. One way to handle that is to introduce additional structures (e.g. rename roccat_settings_report to roccat_settings_report_kone_xtd and then add a slightly different roccat_settings_report_kone_pure) and use conditions (if-oriented-programming ;-)) to handle different devices - there are like around 10 places like that. I would probably introduce several helper functions as some existing functions like roccat_read_profile() are already pretty lengthy. Any better ideas? Note that adding support for more Roccat devices would probably require to push further in that direction, as even XTD Optical seems to differ from 'common' XTD (#421).

I have an XTD, ping me if you need specific testing. I'm also severely ETIME all the time though...

how to tell the driver which mouse model he needs to communicate with.

Exactly like you describe. Those properties are purely implementation-defined and we can change them at will, whenever we feel like it. Pick what you feel comfortable with. DeviceModel can be iffy if you have multiple models sharing the same firmware, but as I said, we can change it anytime anyway.

Some differences between Pure and XTD could be described in the device files

Yep, that would make sense

I would probably introduce several helper functions [...]

What we did for HID++ was to write protocol-only files (hidpp10.c and hidpp20.c) and then a separate driver that uses that protocol (driver-hidpp10.c and driver-hidpp20.c). Since not all devices support all bits of the protocol, this makes the driver easier to read.

We do have generic Logitech device files, because we know well their protocols and we can write one properly. For device we feel uncomfortable having a common driver, there is nothing wrong adding a new one. For example, the Logitech G300 and G600 are similar but completely separated. This avoids having to make device comparisons and keep the drivers simpler.
So one solution could be to rename driver-roccat.c into driver-roccat-kone-xtd.c and have your as driver-roccat-kone-pure.c. This way you could have your driver quicker upstream and collect all of the fame and bug reports from various users :)

The draft pull request visualizes changes that I needed to make to handle Kone Pure mouse. On one hand it borks existing support for Kone XTD. On the other hand it shows how both these mice differ.


My first question is how to tell the driver which mouse model he needs to communicate with. I saw two examples in the existing codebase - the steelseries driver uses DeviceVersion property (1, 2, 3...) and the hidpp10 driver uses ProfileType property (e.g. G700). I'm not sure why there are already have two different properties already. Unfortunately I would prefer a property named DeviceModel as ProfileType is confusing due to the primary meaning of profiles as a set of configuration values. Thoughts?


Some differences between Pure and XTD could be described in the device files, e.g. DpiRange (100:5000@50 vs 200:8200@50), maybe number of buttons as well.


More serious are remaining differences, namely a) different data structures (USB HID GET/SET_REPORT) and button mappings. One way to handle that is to introduce additional structures (e.g. rename roccat_settings_report to roccat_settings_report_kone_xtd and then add a slightly different roccat_settings_report_kone_pure) and use conditions (if-oriented-programming ;-)) to handle different devices - there are like around 10 places like that. I would probably introduce several helper functions as some existing functions like roccat_read_profile() are already pretty lengthy. Any better ideas? Note that adding support for more Roccat devices would probably require to push further in that direction, as even XTD Optical seems to differ from 'common' XTD (#421).


I started documenting Kone Pure protocol here: https://github.com/hipnoizz/libratbag/wiki/Roccat-Kone-Pure if someone is interested. Some of this found it's place in the codebase, but not everything, so I think it is a worthwhile addition anyway.","I think we can come back here if needed, as long as @hipnoizz doesn't delete his fork.",True,{}

So basically, thanks a lot for the code, but I am not sure we want to merge this in libratbag. Battery is a feature that needs to be monitored all the time, and having it in libratbag is not the place.
We should really port this code to the kernel, and thanks to @jwrdegoede we have the code merged in v5.2, so adding those tiny bits in the kernel should be easier now (at least over the lightspeed connector).
So keeping this opened, for references, but I am not sure we should merge the code now, as this would be just for documentation purposes.",True,{}

Signed-off-by: Filipe Laíns lains@archlinux.org","Sure. But basically the 8100 feature doesn't allow us to read past the end of the sector, so we position the offset to prevent us from reading past it (we read 16 bytes at a time so we position it at sector_size - 16).
We are then are are using min(count, 16) to calculate the size to copy, which would be valid if we didn't align the offset. But as we align the offset we need to copy the full 16 bytes to the memory.
Example (to also use as documentation):
Given a sector_size of 64
Read 16 bytes at 0x00 (total 16 bytes read)
Read 16 bytes at 0x10 (total 32 bytes read)
Read 16 bytes at 0x20 (total 48 bytes read)
Read 16 bytes at 0x30 (total 64 bytes read)

Given a sector_size of 70
Read 16 bytes at 0x00 (total 16 bytes read)
Read 16 bytes at 0x10 (total 32 bytes read)
Read 16 bytes at 0x20 (total 48 bytes read)
Read 16 bytes at 0x30 (total 64 bytes read)
Read 16 bytes at 0x36 (total 70 bytes read)

0x36 = 0x46 (70 dec) - 0x10 (16 dec)
After we read at 0x36 we need to copy the full 16 bytes. Using min(count, 16) makes us only copy 6 bytes. This was probably leftover code.",True,{}

most basic one (1 profile, 1 resolution, etc.) and adds a new devel DBus API to load a JSON file with the data to merge into the test device. This makes the test more flexible and more obvious too - it's clear why we can test for say dpi 1300.
I'm planning to squash the test changes into one commit but for easier reviewing it's separated out.

Been using this device file with no issues for a while now.","I didn't know about the receiver.
However, I tried finding the internal id of the mouse with the dmesg method(see below).
This returns a id that is indeed already existing, however when I run libratbag without my modifications It will not detect my mouse.
Ill try to find out why this is.

Also in addition to that, I found that while the mouse is using the wireless dongle it does indeed work in the current version. It does not while it is connected using a wire.(see bottom code block for ratbagd output)
If the mouse is plugged in while ratbagd is running the following output is given:

- Add is_enabled and allows_disabling properties to resolutions
- Implement a new method to in the driver to enable/disable resolutions (only called when allows_disabling is set)
- Make the HID++ 2.0 driver enable allows_disabling for each resolution if the 0x8100 (onboard profiles)
I am pretty sure setting the DPI to 0 to disable it only works in the 0x8100 feature but I will need to check.
Some more details: is_enabled should default to true and allows_disabling should default to false.

That is fine for internal API but it's not a great solution for the public DBus API. I really want to have an enable/disable property in DBus.

If the mouse can add resolutions dynamically, it really makes sense to add DBus APIs for adding/removing resolutions, and we should add an own capability for that. In the static case, where the mouse even reports ""disabled"" resolutions (aka zero dpi), a DBus property would be nice to have, but not strictly necessary* since everything is well defined (see my note at definition of RATBAG_RESOLUTION_CAP_DISABLE).
*Edit this is only the case when we don't have RATBAG_RESOLUTION_SEPARATE_XY_RESOLUTION. So with current supported devices no problem, but it's not a good solution, because then it will start to get messy. So a new resolution property it is.

@FFY00 I squashed the driver debug logs together as suggested, and also added a ""committing"" and ""committed"" output so it's a nice visible block, for example:
ratbag: profile 0 resolution 1: set enabled
ratbag: profile 0 resolution 1: set 6500 dpi

driver: profile 0 resolution 3: 0 dpi
driver: profile 0 resolution 4: 0 dpi
driver: committed

Let me quickly go through the main changes:

I added a new is_disabled property and disabled resolution capability. This needs to be handled internally by the driver, so no super big changes to the common code are actually required here.
Bunch of changes go to the addition of the new DBus API interface, but that's mostly copied from the active/default properties.
The test driver needed some adjustments, and some test had do be edited to not just check for the word disabled.
Sometimes I changed the order in the code, so everywhere it's now first ""active"", then ""disabled"" (sometimes after that ""enabled"") and in the end ""default"". Makes it easier to find code, but maybe looks a little bit confusing when you look at the git changes.",True,{}

It works as well as can be expected.

Also, of course, it's not fully working in piper, as it's just showing the 404-rat, and button 0 and 1 (G1 and G2) only have options for left or right handed, but I guess that's beyond the scope of both libratbag and this PR?",True,{}

The daemon can send that command, however I tried it and it still does not trigger the LED change. I tried several different things but none of them seem to update the LEDs. I will query Logitech about this.

It works as well as can be expected.

This is an old mouse, and I seem to remember that the max DPI was maybe around 8k or 9k, but I would not trust my memory on this.
But the reported info says current profile has only 3 resolutions enabled, but actually they are all set, and I can switch between them using the hardware buttons.
The color of the led seems to be reported correctly: it's blue.
I now manually edited the device file and updated max DPI to 9600, and get the following:

The chosen resolution is reported correctly (I can't be sure about the resolution, but it's the 3rd setting of 5), but if I change it using the hardwarde buttons, ratbagctl info still reports the old setting.  Only after restarting ratbagd it is reporting the correct device state:

Looking at @jdz's log it isn't even reported as a different mouse. If it actually is the same mouse (besides a different ID to show a different image in the Logitech software), I don't see why we shouldn't do it.
I already mentioned it, but the first version of this PR only changed it for the normal version. Changes like the LED and wrong min dpi probably would have gone missing for this model like it did with the USB-ID in Piper.
The questions are:
-Are they actually the same?
-What is the dpi range and step size?

The chosen resolution is reported correctly (I can't be sure about the resolution, but it's the 3rd setting of 5)

Can you try to figure it out? For example by measuring the distance the mouse needs to go from one end of the screen to the other and diving screen width (pixels) by the distance (inches), or using something like https://www.mouse-sensitivity.com/dpianalyzer. I'm not entirely sure if that works correct though.

Once that is in place, you need to add a DBus call to ask for the DeviceType. You need to implement a function in ratbagd-device.c (and probably something similar to this) first.
Then you need to add this function to the vtable. If you are at this point, the hardest part is over.
The last thing is to sync up the python wrappers, adding entries here and here.
If I didn't forget anything, that's it. You can take a look at #870, it also adds a property (although not in the .device file) and exposes it via DBus, so you should fine some similarities. Don't worry if you need tons of revisions, I needed them as well.",True,{}

From my understanding Fedora rawhide is a development version of Fedora, this means the packages themselves are not stable, contrary to Arch Linux. If I am wrong please let me know.

The UI only allows 500 or 1000 for poll rate.
Only a small portion of the buttons are mappable from Piper.
Picture is obviously missing, which is fine, as I assume thats added later.
I assume the LED stuff will show up if i implement the appropriate LED stuff?

Finally, for the space/tab diff thing. VSCode wont show it as anything other than a tab, so I am having trouble fixing it. I considered just running the convert everything to tabs feature in VSCode, but i found the file is a mishmash of spaces and tabs. While I honestly don't care which is used, we need to choose one and stick with it (tabs seems to be the predominant one.)

@FFY00 Whats the recommended way to disable it? Just remove the functions? Or do I flip a flag somewhere? or do i just no-op the functions?
@thesecretmaster Its not hard just takes some setup. You need to have windows or a windows VM to work with. In Windows you install Wireshark and USBpcap. Once you do that, you install Roccat software, load up wireshark, find the mouse and then just look at packets. I usually change a setting in roccat, save it, and see what packets are sent. The tricky part is there is constant spam from the mouse for movement/laser positioning stuff. Its easy to filter if you set a query for a size minimum of the packet. Then you just need to figure out the structure and what does what in the packet. Not hard but very time consuming.",True,{}

It will not be obvious in Piper that the 6 fake LEDs are actually different colors for resolutions that all belong to one single LED.

Let's take for example a mouse that has 4 LEDs but only one, say LED 0, is present on the profiles. This means if you change LEDs 1, 2 or 3 and change the profile, they will stay the same, because they are not configurable per profile. LED 0, however, is configured per profile.
What I am proposing here is to export ratbag profiles with 4 LEDs, but to match the device behavior, if you change LED 1, 2 or 3 on one profile, they are changed on all profiles.
I do not think ratbag profiles need to map exactly to how profiles are implemented in the device. We are abstracting the vendor API for all devices, I do not think it's wise to try to run after an API design that works perfectly for everything.
So, let's think about how this could be implemented? Adding a LED field to resolutions would solve this specific problem, but not similar issues when only some specific fields are configurable via profiles. What I think makes most sense is to allow extra fields independent of profiles.
How would this look like the UI? Well, I'd say exactly as it would with my approach. I don't imagine we would have a different section for / differentiate these standalone fields, people would change the profile and the shared LEDs would still the same.
With that said, I do understand and respect your opinion regarding the approach I am proposing.

If I understand they way rivalcfg does it correctly, we have to multiply DPI value for this mouse by 2.33.
This would mean mean that 7200 DPI our software sets would actually be 3000 or 3100 DPI. It would be nice if you could try setting 3000 or 3100 DPI in official software first, then setting 7200 here, and if it's really the same, I could fix this.",True,{}

So when it comes to the public API, you pick what makes sense for most (or sometimes just: many) devices and go with that. It means you can't do certain things on certain devices, but the alternative is to have device-specific configuration tools for each one of them.
So if there's a device that only handles discrete steps for something we expect a more continuous range - snap to the supported steps in the driver and communicate this back to the client (i.e. Piper) so it can update the UI. But unless there's a significant number of devices that only have a few steps, I wouldn't bother having this exported through the API - it makes every client more complicated for very little benefit.",True,{}

Depending on your local setup, it should be something like

$ git fetch origin   # to make sure we are up to date
$ git rebase origin/master

Setting LED mode on and breathing. off is also supported according to ratbagctl singing-gundi led 0 capabilities but setting it doesn't disable the LED

ratbagctl singing-gundi led 0 set color 000000 does disable the LED tho, so maybe that should be wired to the off mode?
