Feedback requested.","Thanks for the contributions. Looks like failures are in the svg libraries, so definitely unrelated to this.
Minor criticisms: your hexagons are sufficiently distorted that it bugs me, so you might want to fix.  See matplotlib for better ones https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/markers.py#L592.  Similarly the pentagons are a bit off in their proportions.
In general for an n-gon rotated by offset radians you want vertices at x = cos(2*pi*i/n + offset)*size and y = sin(2*pi*i/n + offset)*size but for speed you want to hard-code (possibly approximate) values of the sines and the cosines.
Finally, matplotlib's star marker is an actual 5-pointed star: ‚≠ê  I think it makes sense to follow suit, so I'd either remove star from this PR, or follow suit.

This works fairly well now. We should discuss how to proceed.","To answer the question about how to proceed.  There are two ways we could do this:

the way that this is structured now, where we have the current Agg backend and the new Celiagg backend and you access them with ETS_TOOLKIT=....celiagg or whatever.  We would need to be careful about use of the current Image graphics context and code shouldn't assume the existence of Agg or Celiagg for rendering images (maybe lean more heavily on Pillow for that stuff).
we replace the Agg backend with the Celiagg backend everywhere.  We'd need Celiagg to be reasonably feature-comparable to the current backend before doing this.

I'm not sure which is best.  I'd be happy to see the back of the current Agg wrappers, but they work for the most part, so it may make sense to have a more gradual transition",True,{}

As far as image handling goes, there are a fair number of places in the current codebase (eg. a fair bit in the Chaco image plot, for example) where it is assumed that we have the Agg backend available to do some image processing (usually for re-scaling or messing with alpha channels, rarely for anything that actually uses the Kiva drawing code directly).

Basically, I thought that from kiva.image import GraphicsContext in the pre-change version of this PR was problematic because it was a direct import of a GraphicsContext implementation rather than going through the ETS_TOOLKIT-mediated enable.kiva_graphics_context module (thus creating an implicit dependency on the quirks of the kiva.agg implmentation).

I'm hesitant to have long-living branches for each version. Case in point, #199 was a fix for a broken 4.5.0 SDIST, and here we are making a 4.6.1 for the same reason, all because the problem was fixed in a release branch.
Here's what I recommend instead: All development and bug fixes should happen in the master branch. PRs should be squash merged for convenient cherry-picking. As an exception, release PRs should be merged normally (so the commit with IS_RELEASED = True can be tagged). Then, when a patch release is needed, a new branch should be created from a release tag and fixes cherry-picked from the master branch. If the changes on master since the previous release are fixes/non-breaking, then branching off the release tag should not be necessary.
I feel that this will be easier to get right in the long run, given that this package sees infrequent changes.",True,{'THUMBS_UP': ['https://github.com/jvkersch']}

Also, the agg24 namespace is important. It's meant to keep enable's agg symbols from colliding with matplotlib's agg symbols when both libraries are used in the same process. Crazy, I know. It's a long term dream (pipedream?) of mine to get both libraries to use celiagg.

If we go through KivaFontTrait('modern'), that will parse down to Font(''), which picks up sans-serif anyways. This makes both codepaths consistent. Otherwise, Font('modern') tries to find a typeface actually named ""modern"" when it's intended as a general family, like sans-serif. This causes warnings in these tests as it falls back to the arbitrary default font instead of looking for a proper sans-serif font.","Codecov Report

pyglet gets installed no matter which tests are being run (it's in requirements.txt)
kiva.tests.test_gl_drawing will run its tests as long as importing pyglet does not fail.
We're using an old version of pyglet which appears to be broken on whatever version of Windows is running on Appveyor.

So... Maybe in the short term, we can skip the GL tests on Windows. In the long term, I think the GL backend needs to go. It's incomplete anyways. But I think we need a deprecation warning before just yanking the rug out from underneath people (if these people event exist).",True,{'THUMBS_UP': ['https://github.com/rahulporuri']}

This PR doesn't attempt to actually fix either of the issues #362 or #363 .","Which references #362 and #363, neither of which are fixed here. Right?

Yes. The actual issues i.e. import-time side effects of font_manager and inability to load font files are not addressed here.
This PR simply aims to defer the import-time side effects to when the objects are actually needed. Deferring the imports prevents the tracebacks/logs from appearing when kiva or kiva.fonttools.font.Font are used.
For example, at the moment, simply doing import kiva will cause the tracebacks to appear because kiva.__init__ imports from kiva.fonttools.font and kiva.fonttools.font imports from kiva.fonttools.font_manager.
There are also a few places where Font is instantiated by the relevant findfont or findfontname methods are not used. Those uses also now don't need to worry about seeing this import-time side effect.
Does that answer your question?",True,{}

Everything else in kiva/gl/src was either moved or copied from kiva/add/src (the core C++ bits of the SWIG wrapper)

 Removal of the OpenGL code from the kiva.agg package
 Testing!","So I managed to map out what files are copied, what are new, what are changed etc. Please see the enclosed script at the bottom of this comment.
Summary
Apart from moving GL functionalities out of Agg, the implementations have also been changed, along with large scale styling improvements. Because there are a lot of new files that are copied from existing files and then be modified, the diff is massive to review.
Major changes beyond copying

Text and font related functionalities are reimplemented for GL to raise errors. Text and font related dependencies are also not copied (see graphics_context.i, kiva_gl_constants.h, kiva_graphics_context_base)
Save functionality in GL currently does nothing (not sure if it worked before), but it does not raise or warn.
Most of kiva_graphics_context_base is copied from agg. In addition to skipping text related functions, query methods such as width, height, stride are changed to not use the buffer. rendering_buffer is not copied either (maybe related to the 'GraphicsContext.save' doing nothing.)
resize_gl, draw, draw_to_glcanvas are removed from kiva.agg.plat_support on OSX.
Gradient support is removed when copying kiva/agg/src/agg_typemaps.i over to kiva/gl. It is not clear why it is removed.
A new numpy.i SWIG source is added to kiva/gl/src/swig. It looks brand new, and it will shadow the numpy we all know about?
There is a new kiva.gl subpackage, and with that, a new setup.py file

Minor changes

Some of kiva/agg/agg-24 src and include files are moved to kiva/gl/src/agg. Namespace agg24 is changed to kiva_gl_agg
A lot of styling changes, whitespace, newlines, and changes from ++i to i++ in loops, which should be harmless.

Questions

In kiva_gl_graphics_state.h, the font_type is not defined in the kiva_gl namespace. The SWIG code for kiva.gl.font_type still refers to the kiva::font_type. Would that explain the segfault seen on Linux for QPainterDrawing.test_text and QPainterDraw.test_text_clip?
Why are tests related to QPainter implementation affected by this PR?
Should GraphicsContext.save raise an error or log a warning instead of doing nothing silently (which suggests success)? Similarly, convert_pixel_format may warn if it does not do what was expected.
Why is the numpy.i added?

Detailed breakdown
I was able to identify the files that don't require much review. There are some minor comments in the script to explain some more obvious changes.

macOS builds on Catalina and later can skip OpenGL without losing agg
The agg backend becomes a little bit simpler and (possibly) easier to replace with Celiagg

To that end, I've copied all of the GL-specific code from kiva.agg into a new kiva.gl subpackage. Included in the copy is a very small subset of agg 2.4 which is needed for affine transform, color, and path representations.
This will begin life as a draft PR, because there are a couple of important steps remaining:

 Removal of the OpenGL code from the kiva.agg package
 Testing!","Thank you @jwiggins for the update, and the latest commits (they look like the original commits from the beginning). The changes make sense. The only lingering issue is the segfault on the two text related tests for QPainter on Linux. I don't really know enough about the objectives of those QPainter tests to tell if the failures represent genuine issues we should worry about and what kind of impact downstream it would be. Apart from that, the rest looks good to me.",True,{}

I believe the fixes brought by this PR have been merged to the development branch via the breakout PRs @jwiggins opened (and @pbrod is a co-author). This branch has now, understandably, become largely unmergeable due to merge conflicts. If there are anything we missed and should be extracted into a separate PR, we can come back to this PR that is now recorded.
Is that alright if we close this PR? @jwiggins @pbrod",True,{'THUMBS_UP': ['https://github.com/pbrod']}

Resolves #399

Made wx.VERSION comparison more robust
Made the test examples run on windows and using wx:

Replaced deprecated wx.EVT_XXX(panel, handler) with panel.Bind(wx.EVT_XXX, handler) in  rgba_color_editor.py
Replaced faulty slider.SetTickFreq( 10, 1 ) with slider.SetTickFreq(10) in rgba_color_editor.py
Fixed the failing ToolkitEditorFactory.all_facenames method in kiva_font_editor.py
Replaced deprecated wx.PyPanel with wx.Panel
Changed from enable.wx_backend import Window to from enable.api import Window and moved all imports to the top of the file.
Replaced call to wx.SystemSettings_GetMetric with wx.SystemSettings.GetMetric
Replaced call to deprecated wx.EVT_XXXX( control, self._on_XXXX) with control.Bind(wx.EVT_ERASE_BACKGROUND, self._on_XXXXX)
Fixed a bug in BaseWindow._create_control:
If parent is None it is set to wx.Frame(None) in order to avoid crash in the unit tests.
Replaced wx.WXK_PRIOR and wx.WXK_NEXT (which does not exist on wxpython4)

I tried my best to limit the scope of this PR, but it was difficult to achieve üòÇ .
In summary:

EDM version is upgraded to use RH7 repository.
The test failure in #423 is fixed. The test was failing in the first place but the test was not run on CI before.
Revert half of #386 which caused CI to be run against a released egg of enable instead of local source
Fix test errors complaining about GuiTestAssistant not being implemented on null toolkit (see this comment).
Pin dependencies on traits, traitsui, pyface, apptools to released versions.
Install traits, traitsui, pyface and apptools from EDM, remove Python 3.5 from the CI matrix. (<-- this is a bit opportunistic)

Details:

First commit makes sure the current source is exercised by CI and we get the same failure in #423
The subsequent commit tried to resolve missing link for liblzma from libtiff. The issue affects the most recent libtiff egg for RH6 repository. Upgrading EDM in order to use the RH7 repository resolves this issue.
Avoid #425 by pinning released versions of traits, traitsui, pyface and apptools. Further restrict to TraitsUI<7.1.0. I think the issue should be fixed separately
Fix the error to do with GuiTestAssistant not being available on null toolkit. It came up in the build for #405 as well. Not sure why it only started occurring then.
Revert half of #386 which installs dependencies for running demo examples (it brings in chaco, mayavi etc). Those dependencies bring in the released version of enable, and since then enable CI has not been testing the local source. We don't really need these dependencies for running tests nor for developing enable. It seems reasonable not to install it by default.

Fix #495
Edited message:
The segfault observed was caused by an incorrect use of the QWheelEvent API.  In Qt4, the QWheelEvent's pos and globalpos takes a QPoint type (see doc). However, since Qt5, QWheelEvent API is changed and the pos and globalpos are QPointF instead (see doc, and there are other API changes). For backward compatibility, PySide2/Qt5's QWheelEvent has an overloaded signature to support both, so that code can migrate.  If the signature matches that of Qt4, QPoint is expected for pos and globalpos. If the signature matches that of Qt5, QPointF is expected.
This can be demonstrated with the following script:
from PySide2 import QtCore, QtGui

qt4_args = (
    QtCore.QPoint(0, 0),    # pixelDelta
    QtCore.QPoint(0, 200),  # angleDelta

This PR removes the import side effect of building font cache in the font_manager module. The action of loading fonts and building the cache is deferred until the global font manager singleton is requested.  All code external to font_manager should use the default_font_manager callable to access this font manager singleton.
Benefits of this change:

It seems that if 'clip-path' in node: is always false. Previously it was doing if 'clip-path' in node.keys() where keys() returns the XML attributes, but node was thought to be a dict during a migration from Python 2 to 3 (see #284).

For one thing it imports from another example from basic_move import Box, but it also is using

and using mlab.show() to show the example.
EDIT:  As a sanity check I copy pasted the code for basic_move.Box into this file and changed __main__ to ___main___.  With those changes the demo can be run from etsdemo.  The ___main___ issue I am leaving untouched by this PR (I am not going to add a workaround if __name__ == ""__main__"" or __name__ == ""___main___"":). The other issue has effectively already been resolved in envisage, see enthought/envisage#377.

This PR contributes the kiva and enable examples to etsdemo.
It is currently flagged as a WIP, as some examples are broken / have strange behaviors.  However, some of these problems may best be solved in a separate PR.
EDIT: I have opened issues for any broken demos, and have added comments to this PR for any demos that work when run independently, but not as we want them to when run through etsdemo.
To run the etsdemo app:
pip install -e .[demo]
pip install etsdemo[pyside2]  # or a different gui toolkit
etsdemo

Additionally, some of the kiva examples simply save a file, rather than having a showcased demo.  e,g. dummy, pdf_arcs, star_path.  Not sure what is best approach for these.
I removed the WIP marker, as I think the lingering issues are likely best handled in separate PRs.","For the ones that don't work well, since we are exposing them anyway, what do you think about adding docstrings to warn about that instead of letting the user finding it out for themselves and getting disappointed?
e.g. https://github.com/enthought/traitsui/blob/98b6593d4e8eabb010982861ae977cc8a9d66f79/traitsui/examples/demo/Standard_Editors/TableEditor_demo.py#L5
It is also useful to add a comment referencing the issue you opened. https://github.com/enthought/traitsui/blob/98b6593d4e8eabb010982861ae977cc8a9d66f79/traitsui/examples/demo/Standard_Editors/TableEditor_demo.py#L17
Not only this will set the user's expectation upfront, later we can track down the issue and determine if the warning can be removed. e.g. I was able to remove one warning entirely when the sole issue is resolved: enthought/traitsui@1b7de78#diff-c79f163118f7b6def1f8f0f3fbff5736f8c1679f9d387c6dc4a411a8d437c887
It that sounds good to you, please feel free to do so in a separate PR as it is slightly broader scope.

 - which doesn't work as expected on windows.
Instead of making more modifications to the already messy setup file, I chose to simply import the version info from the package instead of manually searching and compiling the _version.py file for the version info.","Looking deeper into this, I could reproduce the issue on OSX.
Basically we expect the following commands to work for building the documentation:
$ git clone <enable-repo>
$ edm install -e bootstrap click
$ edm run -e bootstrap -- python ci/edmtool.py install
$ edm run -e bootstrap -- python ci/edmtool.py docs

In the install command, write_version_py(in setup.py) is called via pip install. When it writes the _version.py file, the source has been copied to to temporary directory.  e.g. if I make write_version_py raise with the filepath it intends to write to, I get something like this:
    ERROR: Command errored out with exit status 1:
     command: /Users/kchoi/.edm/envs/enable-test-3.6-null/bin/python3 -c 'import sys, setuptools, tokenize; sys.argv[0] = '""'""'/private/var/folders/_6/bw6pnpwx3pzfvhd20ffcpyjm0000gn/T/pip-req-build-n2_nyvnq/setup.py'""'""'; __file__='""'""'/private/var/folders/_6/bw6pnpwx3pzfvhd20ffcpyjm0000gn/T/pip-req-build-n2_nyvnq/setup.py'""'""';f=getattr(tokenize, '""'""'open'""'""', open)(__file__);code=f.read().replace('""'""'\r\n'""'""', '""'""'\n'""'""');f.close();exec(compile(code, __file__, '""'""'exec'""'""'))' egg_info --egg-base /private/var/folders/_6/bw6pnpwx3pzfvhd20ffcpyjm0000gn/T/pip-req-build-n2_nyvnq/pip-egg-info

    ValueError: /private/var/folders/_6/bw6pnpwx3pzfvhd20ffcpyjm0000gn/T/pip-req-build-n2_nyvnq/kiva/_version.py

So the kiva/_version.py and enable/_version.py are written to that temporary directory. The _version.py files are then copied to the site-packages as part of the installation step, so the installed packages should have the _version.py files.
However, the conf.py assumes the _version.py file is written in the source root directory, which would be true if it was from the source distribution. But when we run the docs command from edmtool.py, it isn't the source distribution, and as explained above, the _version.py is not there, so conf.py fails.
In other ETS projects, like Traits and TraitsUI where the setup.py file has been revamped, the target version file path is computed much early on, so that the _version.py would be written to the source directory, instead of the temporary directory mentioned above.",True,{}

Note that I haven't looked at the tests. Note also that there are a few modules which have copyright headers which refer to Greenbank Computing Inc or the Space Telescope Science Institute. In those cases, I didn't remove the copyright header.
This PR is in preparation for the automated addition of copyright headers to all of the modules in enable and kiva.","@rahulporuri Could you elaborate on why these copyright headers are ""bad""? Are they acknowledging the wrong parties? They contain the wrong years? Or they are bad because they don't conform to the copyright header format we now have?

Most of the above - in some cases it was wrong year ranges, in other cases it was the wrong format.

Therefore I'd be more in favour of replacing the copyright headers with better ones in a single PR than removing these acknowledgment in one PR and then adding different ones later at an unknown time.

Makes sense. I'll work on updating the headers in this PR itself instead of opening a separate PR.",True,{}

No, it's because they are implementation detail to be hidden, like you mentioned in a later comment.

I am wondering if kiva/trait_defs/ui/wx needs to receive the same treatment.

I don't think we're painting ourselves into a corner, because the API of the toolkit object will remain unchanged (you call it with a string to get the toolkit version of the object), so we could just add additional entrypoints with different names and targets (eg. 'qt.image' or 'qt_image' or something) and then deprecate the ones from this PR (there might be some weird corner cases where they might break, but until we have an actual external implementation everything should be fine).",True,{}

There are some edge-cases that I can see around what happens if the resolution changes while the window is live (either by the user changing the resolution, or moving between screens), but as-is should be no worse than what we have now.  I think it can be supported in Qt if we wanted to go there, but worst case is that you get low-resolution images after moving from low-res to high-res; or you render at high-res when working with low-res.

:D Not really. I was going to ask if we could flake8 kiva.fonttools now that it's all new and fancy - but i checked and it's already flake8 clean (except for two imports in the __init__). I thought I needed to reiterate my stance that it should be safe to ship this code as we don't have any internal (enthought) users of the removed code - but you already mentioned it. Me saying it would have been redundant after having already said it on other PRs. I browsed through the code locally and it looks good to me.
I guess the only thing i can say is - given the amount of time you've spend digging into kiva.fonttools, is there information in your head that's not already in the code/docstrings/existing docs that's worth documenting? i didn't think there was any apart from esoteric details about fonts/font handling/fontTools, which is why i didn't bring it up earlier
I guess we could ask internally if anyone has qualms with the refactor/cleanup. It couldn't hurt. I guess?

Additionally, kiva.fonttools.afm is being removed completely now that #700 has been merged.
This PR will break any code which explicitly tries to muck about with the creation of the system font cache. A nice API for this will arrive with the resolution of #555. This PR will also break any code which was calling functions that have been moved to the new private kiva.fonttools modules.

A good question. I would say ""Yes"", but only because that's how things normally go. That said, I think with the tests and logically separating the parts out into modules probably means that I could understand this code in six months when I've lost the context. That's my hope at least. In the meantime, it might be nice to see if Kit has the time to take a look and give her opinion on the state of things.
There is still one big fix I'd like to address. That's the bad fallback font selection. ""vera.ttf"" doesn't exist on macOS, so it would be nice to have a slightly more sane fallback font selection process.",True,{}

At last we've arrived. This PR removes a ton of code from kiva.fonttools.font_manager, leaving only FontManager, fontManager and default_font_manager as the things we're [sort of] OK with people importing. Really, everyone should just use Font and don't peek under the covers (unless writing a Kiva backend).
Additionally, kiva.fonttools.afm is being removed completely now that #700 has been merged.
This PR will break any code which explicitly tries to muck about with the creation of the system font cache. A nice API for this will arrive with the resolution of #555. This PR will also break any code which was calling functions that have been moved to the new private kiva.fonttools modules.

It seems like this fix is going to require a change in behavior and may potentially ""break"" existing code.
Currently the end_drag_on_leave flag does not actually lead to a drag being ""ended"" on a mouse leave.  Instead it is canceled.  My thoughts were to either add a cancel_drag_on_leave trait to do what end_drag_on_leave currently does (ie cancel the drag) and change end_drag_on_leave to actually end (see first commit). However, this requires one of these having preference over the other if both are True, and in actuality you would only ever want one behavior, so I removed end_drag_on_leave and made a new on_drag_leave enum trait.
This however is a change in the public api so we need to tread very carefully.  I am unsure what exactly we want to go with here, and thus am leaving this as a WIP for now awaiting further discussion.

A concrete example use case, coming straight from the horse's mouth, would be ""trying to enclose something with a bounding box near the border of an image"".

Basically, the current implementation is:
if a user sets end_drag_on_leave = True the existing behavior is completely preserved aside from a deprecation warning being raised.  The deprecation warning is raised when the trait is used, ie when a mouse leave event is triggered if it is set.  Perhaps the deprecation warning would better live in a trait change handler to raise whenever the trait is changed? (as I am writing this I think that may make more sense... ü§î).  The new on_drag_leave trait is effectively ignored (to avoid any potential conflicts).  This way existing code in the wild can go on as is without risk of breaking.  I've added the deprecation warning and added to comments / docstrings to make it more clear that end_drag_on_leave actually means drag_cancel will be called.  Nonetheless the trait is kept exactly as is, we just warn about it being potentially confusing / misleading.
If a user does not explicitly set end_drag_on_leave = True, they are free to use the new feature.  Namely, they can chose to set the new on_drag_leave enum trait to either ""end"" or ""cancel"" to do what you would expect given the choice.  This provides the appropriate level of flexibility and lets users chose what they want.  Whether you want to cancel or end on a leave or do nothing is context specific, and users should be free to decide on the appropriate behavior for their particular usecase.
finally, if neither trait is set, behavior is preserved as the on_drag_leave defaults to None.
I've added unit tests to check the on_drag_leave options work as expected, and that on_drag_leave does nothing if end_drag_on_leave is set.
Note that this means if users want the new feature to end on leave not cancel after having perviously had end_drag_on_leave = True, they have to set on_drag_leave = 'end' and remove the end_drag_on_leave = True.",True,{}

Now uses a bottom left origin
Fixed image drawing
Fixed color selection in jwiggins/blend2d-python#17
Fixed saving (BGRA -> RGBA)

A small program which fetches http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Scripts.txt, parses it, and writes out the kiva.fonttools.text._data module.

I then ran brew install swig and re-ran pip install enable-5.1.0.dev280.tar.gz and I see:

A follow up PR will be needed to raise an exception in setup.py if we have the wrong swig version.","1st part of #769
This PR simply includes a pyproject.toml file specifying cython and numpy as build dependencies.
I ran python setup.py sdist, created a fresh environment and ran pip install enable-5.1.0.dev280.tar.gz
previously I saw:
$ pip install enable-5.1.0.dev280.tar.gz

A follow up PR will be needed to raise an exception in setup.py if we have the wrong swig version.","I then ran brew install swig and re-ran pip install enable-5.1.0.dev280.tar.gz and I see:

I am slightly surprised. I was under the impression that we won't need to install build dependencies manually if a pyproject.toml is setup correctly. The same way runtime dependencies of enable are inferred and installed, I thought the build dependencies would be inferred and installed as well :/ Im an idiot. That's exactly what's expected - because we can't install swig from pypi so we can't specify it in the toml file.",True,{}

I'm not exactly sure how to do this using the marker, because the markers _add_to_path method seems to assume it is drawing at (0,0).  I tried to, rather than calling draw_path_at_points, create a singular path, move to the point for each triangle to be drawn and call marker.add_to_path on that path, then call gc.add_path on that path.
However when doing this all the triangles draw at the origin.
e.g:




It seems lines works with absolute locations.
If I were to try to continue to follow the above suggestion, I could instead just write my own add_to_path function which simply adds a triangle to the path relative to a certain point.  However at that point, the marker becomes unneeded.  Or,  could use translate_ctm but then the calculation of points for the triangles may need to change.
At that point, I might as well rewrite it entirely to not use markers, and not work with ""centers"" of the triangles which simplifies the math.  I will work on this but given it will involve a large rework of the example, I might just open a separate PR implementing that approach.",True,{}

Don't use markers or GC transforms. Just create a path object using recursive calls and then draw it with a single draw call.

After searching chaco for bg_color there are a few uses, but the majority of which bg_color is used as a temp variable that is passed to bgcolor.  eg bgcolor=bg_color.
There are 2 problem uses tho:
https://github.com/enthought/chaco/blob/54a1b929d3e3932bc79e17de5995658bd30e1b37/examples/demo/basic/contour_cmap_plot.py#L65

All uses occur in example code, not in library code.

Note that CaselessLiteral inherits from Token which in turn inherits from ParserElement, which contains the property name and the new set_name public API.

Well, okay, in this case, I am sure that it's not just by looking at the results, but more generally ...)

Unfortunately we don't have any way of telling whether the given description is ""matching"" a font - basically this generates a font object which is passed over to the backend to do whatever it will with it.  What Qt does with that in the QPainter backend follows a completely different path compared to what the agg backends do, and there is currently no feedback on what the result is.
And in all cases it ""matches"" something, it's just that the match might be really bad.
So in this it's a lot like CSS fonts: you can type whatever you want as a font descriptor in CSS, but whether the browser renders anything like what you asked for is hugely dependent on the browser, the OS, the user's installed fonts, what you make available via the website, etc.
Even the simple version of the editor might be misleading: it's allowing you to select fonts via the Qt/OS font dialog, but if you are rendering with agg it may not 100% agree with what Qt thinks you have available.
