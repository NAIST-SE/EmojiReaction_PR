proxysql_galera_writer.pl sets the number of write nodes, but doesn't check health

With this modification only 1 script is needed: proxysql_galera_checker.sh
It will check node health for a maximum of 2 hosgroups (writers and readers), set the number of writers and disable reads in writers (only if at least 1 reader node is online).
Usage of the script has changed:
proxysql_galera_checker.sh <hostgroup_id write> [hostgroup_id read] [number writers] [writers are readers 0|1} [log_file]

Only the first parameter is required, rest is optional",Thank you @fmbiete and @krzysztof-ksiazek,True,{}

@renecannao","Hi Donatas,
In general, if a database server is reporting an error, it is a red flag.
Although, there are a list of errors that are filtered out: 1044 , 1045 and 1049.
The reason why they are filtered is that a misconfiguration (1044 and 1045) or user can intentionally (1049) shun the database server.
Error 1226 (has exceeded the 'max_user_connections' resource) is somehow tricky: if a database server has reached a limit because of that user, maybe there is a problem.
I think the issue should be solved in a different way: ProxySQL should limit the number of connections to backend per user (right now, it is only per server).
A solution, already possible, is to create a hostgroup per user, and in this way is easy to define a maximum number of connection per user.
I will merge this pull request, as right now seems an efficient way to solve the issue.
But to reiterated, I think ProxySQL should prevent this error to happen, limiting the number of connections at database level.
Thanks,
René",True,{}

We've just moved to cloud, and started using XtraDB cluster. We've experienced some troubles with highload, so we opened couple of servers for read and write. But it also cause us some troubles like deadlocks. The possible solution for this was making one Cluster Node for write and others for readonly.
We've searching for solutions and found yours, which is great.
But for now we can't use it due to transactions. For example:
BEGIN; ## Starting transaction
INSERT INTO testTable (value) (10); ## Inserting some value, for example deposit amount
SELECT SUM(value) FROM testTable; ## Finding sum of deposits
INSERT INTO testTableRelation (maxValue) (10); ##Saving sum of deposits for client.
COMMIT; ##Commiting transaction

If I have rules, like:
select rule_id,match_pattern,destination_hostgroup from mysql_query_rules; 
+---------+------------------------+-----------------------+
| rule_id | match_pattern          | destination_hostgroup |
+---------+------------------------+-----------------------+
| 1       | ^SELECT                | 2                     |
| 2       | .*                     | 1                     |
+---------+------------------------+-----------------------+

Select will go through destination hostgroup, which includes readonly servers, which don't know about transaction yet, so I wouldn't get actual sum of deposits. And flagIN, flagOUT works only for each query separately.
So I've come up with an idea:
select rule_id,match_pattern,flagIN,flagOUT,destination_hostgroup,sticky_flag from mysql_query_rules; 
+---------+------------------------+--------+---------+-----------------------+-------------+
| rule_id | match_pattern          | flagIN | flagOUT | destination_hostgroup | sticky_flag |
+---------+------------------------+--------+---------+-----------------------+-------------+

| 5       | ^ROLLBACK              | 1      | NULL    | 1                     | 0           |
| 6       | ^COMMIT                | 1      | NULL    | 1                     | 0           |
| 7       | .*                     | 1      | 1       | 1                     | 1           |
| 100     | ^SELECT                | 0      | NULL    | 2                     | 0           |
| 1000    | .*                     | 0      | NULL    | 1                     | 0           |
+---------+------------------------+--------+---------+-----------------------+-------------+

I added new parameter - sticky_flag, which means that if the sticky_flag is true, we will begin next query with current flagOUT
For example:
SELECT * FROM testTableRelation; ## Getting sum of deposits for client
## rule_id = 100, flagIN = 0, flagOUT = 0, sticky_flag = 0, hostgroup = 2,
## Works like earlier (hostgroup = 2, readonly Node)

BEGIN; ## Starting transaction
## rule_id = 3, flagIN = 0, flagOUT = 1, sticky_flag = 1, hostgroup = 1
## Saves flagOUT = 1 to session, so it will be flagIn starting value on next query
## Works like earlier, hostgroup = 1, write Node

INSERT INTO testTable (value) (10); ## Inserting some value, for example deposit amount
## rule_id = 7, flagIN = 1, flagOUT = 1, sticky_flag = 1, hostgroup = 1
## Saves flagOUT = 1 to session, so it will be flagIn starting value on next query
## Works like earlier, hostgroup = 1, write Node

SELECT SUM(value) FROM testTable; ## Finding sum of deposits
## rule_id = 7, flagIN = 1, flagOUT = 1, sticky_flag = 1, hostgroup = 1
## Saves flagOUT = 1 to session, so it will be flagIn starting value on next query
## New working flow, select query went to write Node, cause it's the only node, that knows about transaction, so it will get correct result

INSERT INTO testTableRelation (maxValue) (10); ##Saving sum of deposits for client.
## rule_id = 7, flagIN = 1, flagOUT = 1, sticky_flag = 1, hostgroup = 1
## Saves flagOUT = 1 to session, so it will be flagIn starting value on next query
## Works like earlier, hostgroup = 1, write Node

COMMIT; ##Commiting transaction
## rule_id = 6, flagIN = 1, flagOUT = NULL, sticky_flag = 0, hostgroup = 1
## Resets sticky_flag to false in session, so next time starting value for flagIN will be 0.

SELECT SUM(value) FROM testTable; ## Finding sum of deposits
## rule_id = 100,  flagIN = 0, flagOUT = NULL, sticky_flag = 0, hostgroup = 2
## Works like earlier (hostgroup = 2, readonly Node)

My version is not perfect, also I don't use C++ much, but we've tested it, and it is working like it supposed to.","Hello Rene,

We've just moved to cloud, and started using XtraDB cluster. We've experienced some troubles with highload, so we opened couple of servers for read and write.

I assume you were already familiar with mysql_users.transaction_persistent .
I must say the way you described how to solve this issue is really interesting!
I was already working on a different solution: I am sure you noticed fields sticky_conn and multiplex in mysql_query_rules, but isn't ready yet.
The way sticky_conn will work (isn't implemented yet) is that it will be possible to make a hostgroup/connection sticky based on a query rules.
I think the main difference between the two approaches are:

sticky_flag : it applies to the next query only
sticky_conn : it applies to all the query until sticky_conn is disabled again

I think the two approaches can live together, as they aren't mutually exclusive.
I will review the code later today: thank you again!
Few comments I have are:

flagOUT is used for current query: making it dual purposes can be confusing
related to point 1, instead of adding a flag (sticky_flag) I think will be less confusing and more efficient to have a column named next_query_flagOUT , so that the current query roles chaining is not affected (similar to mirror_flagOUT).
Thoughts?

I added new parameter - sticky_flag, which means that if the sticky_flag is true, we will begin next query with current flagOUT
For example:
SELECT * FROM testTableRelation; ## Getting sum of deposits for client
## rule_id = 100, flagIN = 0, flagOUT = 0, sticky_flag = 0, hostgroup = 2,
## Works like earlier (hostgroup = 2, readonly Node)

BEGIN; ## Starting transaction
## rule_id = 3, flagIN = 0, flagOUT = 1, sticky_flag = 1, hostgroup = 1
## Saves flagOUT = 1 to session, so it will be flagIn starting value on next query
## Works like earlier, hostgroup = 1, write Node

INSERT INTO testTable (value) (10); ## Inserting some value, for example deposit amount
## rule_id = 7, flagIN = 1, flagOUT = 1, sticky_flag = 1, hostgroup = 1
## Saves flagOUT = 1 to session, so it will be flagIn starting value on next query
## Works like earlier, hostgroup = 1, write Node

SELECT SUM(value) FROM testTable; ## Finding sum of deposits
## rule_id = 7, flagIN = 1, flagOUT = 1, sticky_flag = 1, hostgroup = 1
## Saves flagOUT = 1 to session, so it will be flagIn starting value on next query
## New working flow, select query went to write Node, cause it's the only node, that knows about transaction, so it will get correct result

INSERT INTO testTableRelation (maxValue) (10); ##Saving sum of deposits for client.
## rule_id = 7, flagIN = 1, flagOUT = 1, sticky_flag = 1, hostgroup = 1
## Saves flagOUT = 1 to session, so it will be flagIn starting value on next query
## Works like earlier, hostgroup = 1, write Node

COMMIT; ##Commiting transaction
## rule_id = 6, flagIN = 1, flagOUT = NULL, sticky_flag = 0, hostgroup = 1
## Resets sticky_flag to false in session, so next time starting value for flagIN will be 0.

SELECT SUM(value) FROM testTable; ## Finding sum of deposits
## rule_id = 100,  flagIN = 0, flagOUT = NULL, sticky_flag = 0, hostgroup = 2
## Works like earlier (hostgroup = 2, readonly Node)

New field next_query_flagIN sets flagIN starting value for next query, this starting value changes, if only next_query_flagIN >= 0  (like mirror_flagOUT works)
It appears that I don't need flagOUT at all, but it still works
Example:
SELECT * FROM testTableRelation; ## Getting sum of deposits for client
## rule_id = 100, flagIN = 0, next_query_flagIN = -1, hostgroup = 2,
## Works like earlier (hostgroup = 2, readonly Node)

BEGIN; ## Starting transaction
## rule_id = 3, flagIN = 0, next_query_flagIN = 1, hostgroup = 1
## Sets next_query_flagIN = 1 to session, so it will be flagIN starting value on next query
## Works like earlier, hostgroup = 1, write Node

INSERT INTO testTable (value) (10); ## Inserting some value, for example deposit amount
## rule_id = 7, flagIN = 1, next_query_flagIN = 1, hostgroup = 1
## Doesn't change next_query_flagIN, so it stays equals 1
## Works like earlier, hostgroup = 1, write Node

SELECT SUM(value) FROM testTable; ## Finding sum of deposits
## rule_id = 7, flagIN = 1, next_query_flagIN = 1, hostgroup = 1
## Doesn't change next_query_flagIN, so it stays equals 1
## New working flow, select query went to write Node, cause it's the only node, that knows about transaction, so it will get correct result

INSERT INTO testTableRelation (maxValue) (10); ##Saving sum of deposits for client.
## rule_id = 7, flagIN = 1, next_query_flagIN = 1, hostgroup = 1
## Doesn't change next_query_flagIN, so it stays equals 1
## Works like earlier, hostgroup = 1, write Node

COMMIT; ##Commiting transaction
## rule_id = 6, flagIN = 1, next_query_flagIN = 0, hostgroup = 1

We've just moved to cloud, and started using XtraDB cluster. We've experienced some troubles with highload, so we opened couple of servers for read and write. But it also cause us some troubles like deadlocks. The possible solution for this was making one Cluster Node for write and others for readonly.
We've searching for solutions and found yours, which is great.
But for now we can't use it due to transactions. For example:
BEGIN; ## Starting transaction

Select will go through destination hostgroup, which includes readonly servers, which don't know about transaction yet, so I wouldn't get actual sum of deposits. And flagIN, flagOUT works only for each query separately.

Agreed, it is old! We have a need for a centos5 build internally, and I figured it might be worth contributing that work back just in case someone else has an old Centos server hanging around too.
Correct, the only defect we've found so far is the lack of epoll_create1 in the glibc that ships with CentOS 5. Given that proxysql is using epoll_create1() in a way that is backwards compatible with the deprecated epoll_create() I thought it was pretty safe.

Thank you for the PR.
Although, I will close this PR and implement it in a different way.
A bit more context on why I will implement differently:

the information is already available here : it only needs to be made available in SHOW MYSQL STATUS
time() is not safe: if someone change the clock of the system, the result will be incorrect. This is why the current solution already uses monotonic time.

I think that checking the string length is correct (if two strings don't have the same length they are surely different) and efficient (no need to make any call to the memory allocator, and strncmp (or strcmp) won't be called at all.
The current bug is here: (l > _l ? l : _l)
The 3rd argument of strncmp is the length of the new schemaname if that is longer than the length of the current schemaname, otherwise the old schemaname.
This fixed the issue in #609 (new schemaname longer than old schemaname), but what you reported in #1016 is exactly the opposite (old schemaname longer than new schemaname).
But the truth is that strncmp shouldn't be called at all if old/new schemaname have different lengths: surely they can't be the same!
Therefore the final fix should be something like:
if ((schemaname==NULL) || (l != _l) || (strncmp(_new,schemaname, l ))) {

Schemaname is set if any of these is true:

is currently NULL
new/old schemaname have different length
if they have same length, they differ

The commit looks good to me. Merging it.

This is a reasonably expensive variant of clock_gettime, because it's so accurate, but I'm not doing anything with the statistics being collected into query_processor_time and backend_query_time and I'd like to be able to turn them off.
This patch turns collecting these statistics off by default, and adds a -p param to enable collecting them. You may prefer to make this tuneable via the admin SQL interface but this seemed to be the smallest change to the code, so I went this route.

I tested on a 4 socket, 32 core, 64bit Ubuntu 14.04 machine with sysbench 1.0.2 and Linux kernel 3.19. I used this ProxySQL fork both collecting the time stats and not with this sysbench config:
sysbench --time=60 --mysql-port=6033 --mysql-host=127.0.0.1 \
--oltp-table-size=214748364800 --oltp-test-mode=complex \
--mysql-db=sysbench --mysql-user=root --mysql-password=root \
--oltp-read-only=off --threads=32 --report-interval=5 \
--events=10000000 --rate=1000 \
/usr/share/sysbench/tests/include/oltp_legacy/select.lua run
While this was running I collected stats using strace again, with this command line:
strace -fp $PID -cc -e trace'!=poll,nanosleep' & (sleep 10 && killall -INT strace)
The ProxySQL config was the default proxysql.cfg that ships with the source code.

If you're happy with the concept I'm happy to work on changes to the code to fit your design principles or coding standards.","In deploying ProxySQL we see very high levels of system CPU time -- a lot of what it's doing is recving from one socket and sending to another, so this make sense, and a great deal of time is spent in poll -- but checking production nodes with strace -fp $pid -cc -e trace=!poll,nanosleep shows that up to a third of our system calls are to clock_gettime, specifically the CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID variant.

Thank you for the patch!
The timing for this PR is very interesting: I was chatting with someone about the performance implication of clock_gettime() right when you submitted the PR.
Indeed, I think the best solution is to make it a global variable and not a cmdline option.
I will work on it and get it ready in the next few hours.",True,{}

a) input validation ( if (strlen(qr->client_addr) > ) should be done only once, when the rule is loaded

In this way, even instances of proxysql running in a docker container are killed.
My solution works by wrapping the ""kill $i"" command in a ""safe_kill"" function.
""safe_kill"" kills the process id only if it is not running inside a docker container.
Flow:


finding the parent id  of the process we are going to kill
(parent_pid=ps -f $pid | grep proxysql |  awk '{print $3}')


checking if the parent id is a docker instance
(is_pid_child_of_docker $parent_pid)

If mysql-web_enabled is enabled, ProxySQL allows to display historical data using a web interface.

Do you have a reproducible test case?
I am curious to know if this issue is still present in v2.0 , where mysql_servers.weight is capped to 10M:

We currently have a set up of 3 galera nodes per HG (using 3 writers) and weights of (1000M, 1000, 1) so we can assure almost all the writes go to the proper node and we can avoid deadlocks. Reducing the max weight to 10M will imply for us a much bigger chance of having deadlocks on writes.
Changing those weights to uint_64 shouldn't have a big performance hit and also can allow you to increase the max weight for the cases (like this) where having a big difference of weights is needed.",True,{}

#1904
As per the issue, I found a problem when parsing sql_mode.
When parsing the SESSION variable, it seems that interpretation becomes impossible if CONCAT function is nested.
SQL to be parsed.
SET @@SESSION.sql_mode = CONCAT(CONCAT(@@sql_mode, ', STRICT_ALL_TABLES'), ', NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO');

This session variable is commonly used in RoR.
Expected results.
key = sql_mode
value = CONCAT(CONCAT(@@sql_mode, ',STRICT_ALL_TABLES'), ',NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO')

Actual results.
key = sql_mode
value = CONCAT

its index position should be in the first half of the array
new elements are added and removed to the array in such a way that its index position should always be in the first half of the array.

Right. It will only overflow when throttling is disabled, but it doesn't matter.

Merged in 1.4.16 .
In 2.0 , the max value for weight is 10M .
Assuming the standard header defines RAND_MAX as 2147483647 (2^31-1), you needs 215 servers in the same hostgroup with max weight to trigger an overflow: unlikely, but still not ideal.
In commit d1ac946 I added a microbenchmark related to this PR.
It seems that the use of double causes performance overhead between 20-30% , but this can be ignored since the difference is in the order of 10ns .",True,{}

These errors seems to correspond to SQLITE_BUSY error of SQLite.

#define SQLITE_LOCKED       6   /* A table in the database is locked */

As you avoided it by sleeping when SQLITE_LOCKED occurs previously,
I think we can avoid it by sleeping even when SQLITE_BUSY occurs.

You're right. proxysql cannot determine which writer is right. At most, It can only make sure the first writer it found is in the writer group. The first must be the right.
let's explore it a little deeper.
In what situation does proxysql needs to determine the right writer?
On proxysql start(or proxysql crash and restart) and there are multiple servers with read_only =0.
In this case,the configuration in mysql_servers must explicitly indicate a server is writer,and saved to disk, this is the initial right writer. proxysql can make sure this writer is in the writer group on start.
So, there is a writer in writer group online, all other writers later detected will be banned.
Suppose a slave's read_only is changed to 0 by mistake. proxysql will prevent this server from being moved into the writer group, and print warning logs like:

If DBA find this situation in time and correct the read_only on slave, data inconsistency can be avoided.
If not,  some day,the original writer in the writer group down for some reason,  this slave will be moved into the writer group. However, this slave may not be ready for writing because of replication lag. So there is still a little chance of causing data problem. But it is caused by misconfiguration, and proxysql has tried hard to point it out.
So there is still  the risk of writing to slave . but it is under control now. We got time to correct the mistake before writing to slave really happens.
In practice, we can monitor the warning log using Zabbix to find the mistake timely.",True,{}

That was not needed. When compiled in debug mode, you can access the database from Admin, schema myhgm. Run this to confirm:
SHOW DATABASES;
SHOW TABLES FROM myhgm;

By the way, to be honest I am not completely happy with the design of Galera checks, because each node is checked independently and then Monitor takes action immediately while trying to not conflict with other checks.
For Aurora I am working on a different approach: for each cluster, a dedicated thread will check all the nodes of the cluster. This avoids conflicts.

as proxysql was looking for a host:port in a HG != writer_hg that was including all HGs setup and not only the ones related with that galera HG.
Also once the happy case was working for us we saw that for desync / shunned nodes, they were deleted from runtime_mysql_servers instead of moving them to the offline HG so it was unable to recover the nodes after recovering the node. Now shunned / offline_soft nodes will be moved to offline_hg so when they are up again they will be moved to the corresponding HG (writer / reader / backup) as set up.

In the context of Galera, a writer_hostgroup represent a cluster.
Although it is technically possible for a server to be part of multiple hostgroups (and this is quite common), the Galera module wasn't designed to have a server part of multiple clusters. Thus i understand why your case doesn't work.
But I want to to ask: why do you have such setup? Why do you have a single server part of multiple clusters? Am I missing something?",True,{}

First I need to thank you and the Proxysql team for having developed a such powerful and helpful tool. We're really enjoying it and using it on production since some months in our large multi-DCs Galera-based MySQL installation.
Since we're widely using and testing it we found some limitation that we need to address for moving to Proxysql 2.0 with its native galera support.
In our setup we split the load (read+write traffic together) by software configuration across all the nodes in the clusters, that allows use to not over/under use any of the nodes.
We archive this in two ways:

A schema-level configuration: all traffic for one schemas goes on the same node, taking into account we manage big boxes with multiple database schemas deployed.
A table-level configuration using logical sharding: for the target PK values our internal software library calculates the right table numeric suffix (so the tables are like table1 or table2 or tableX)  and then check/use the appropriate database configuration for that specific [range of] table.

Each Galera Cluster has its own Proxysql deployment (multiple pods) that manage the traffic in front of it with multiple HGs configured.
Each Host Group has one of the server configured as ""primary"", the remaining ones as ""secondary"".
When all the nodes are online, each of them takes only its own specific set of traffic (schemas+tables), that's why I called ""primary"", despite the technical definition should be ""preferred node"".
If this node goes down the traffic is routed to one of the remaining available nodes.
This is the reason why every single server is part of multiple HGs, because each server is the preferred one in one HGs and takes almost all the traffic, in the remaining HGs the same server it's configured to be used only in case of loss of the preferred.
In order to define the preferred node in a given HG where we have 3 ONLINE nodes, using proxysql 1.4.x we're playing with server weights like assigning value of 1000000 to the 1st node, 1000 for 2nd node and 1 for 3rd node.
This is because we don't like/adopt the logic of the existing galera checker script and don't want to wait for scheduler/checker script actions when a node goes down.
So in every HG we always have 3 or more available nodes but we send traffic ""mostly"" to only one of them, since the weight-ratio traffic distribution it's not super precise, but we don't care.
Our goal is to have proxysql 2.0 fully natively capable of managing all the Galera cluster possible server/node status while having the same server in multiple HGs if needed.
As a context information, we have a 1:1 ration between read and write traffic, so we don't need to use one node for writes and multiple ones for reads, we ""only"" need extremely high availability and fast traffic switching.
Once a server has a problem (goes down or become desync or whatever) we need to move traffic as soon as possible in terms of sub-seconds, and IMHO using proxysql internal monitor is the best solution for this job, so let's improve it!
Please let me know if our uses case and our way of using proxysql makes sense to you and please do not hesitate to ask, comment or suggest anything.
I'm of course open to any deeper discussion about it, you can poke me on Slack directly  :)",True,{}

I have found the reason of the weird flapping of the nodes when proxysql has load. in MySQL_Monitor.cpp::monitor_galera_thread() sometimes the query you make for getting the state of nodes, sometimes is getting partial results (3 columns instead of 7), so after that is making decissions of which nodes to put offline without the proper info.
I'm not sure of the reason of this, maybe a bug in that mariadb lib version, or a dangling pointer... I checked the network packaged with wireshark and everything looked ok to me. I tried changing the goto by a return, and it's working fine, but i think that's not a fix, just a workaround.

We were having this same issue on v2.0.4, I've tried to update to v2.0.5 based on release and the problem was still there. After update to the latest commit on v2.0.5, the problem with procedures was fixed.
I think you could just update the tag and re-generate the release.

This change is related to unexpected timeouts we were having that derivated in node shunning. After a lot of debugging we saw that the cause of those timeouts came from this function.
The main problem was that if wait_for_mysql set the status as timed_out, the loop will never check again with mysql_query_cont or mysql_ping_cont which from my perspective looks to be in charge of managing this variable. If this happened, the code will be looping until the timer mysql_thread___monitor_read_only_timeout or the ping one expired without checking if there is an answer from mysql (which i saw that sometimes having wait_for_mysql reporting timeout i got a proper answer from mysql).
After seeing this the idea of my change was to add a sleep of the size of mysql_get_timeout_value_ms() which is the timeout you are doing in the poll and report a timeout only when our timer expired or mysql_query/ping_cont reports as timeout.
I think this shouldn't be against using the async api, as can be as responsive as the other aproach using the proper sleep times.",True,{}

In that case (i think i also reported it) there was an issue receiving partial state of the nodes which made proxysql behave bad in several cases.
In this case the only thing is that a timeout is reported when there isn't a ""real"" timeout (i mean real timeout taking into account the values set up in proxysql config) as it's checking against mysql_get_timeout_value_ms() and never checking the query / ping answer between that first timeout and the one you have setup in proxysql's config",True,{}

According to documentation , CLIENT_PS_MULTI_RESULTS cannot be set in mysql_real_connect() .
Although, this seems to contradict the code in MySQL client library, that uses the flags as they are passed to mysql_real_connect() (a documentation bug?)
Multi resultsets are automatically enabled either setting CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS or CLIENT_PS_MULTI_RESULTS. And to make things more interesting, CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS is automatically enabled when CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS is enabled.
So I think the check should be a more more complex:

if CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS is enabled on both frontend and backend, no further check is needed
if CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS is not enabled (of course, on both frontend and backend), if the client has CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS or CLIENT_PS_MULTI_RESULTS enabled, we need to verify that the backend connection has CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS or CLIENT_PS_MULTI_RESULTS enabled. And when creating a backend connection, we would match whichever of these 2 flags the client has set.
Seems reasonable?",True,{}

Now Azure MySQL R&Ds are doing the work of removing the ‘@' + 'server' in the username information, which will be online soon. However, a new connection attribute '_server_host' which contains the hostname information is added. This attribute has been already added in driver MariaDB Connector C and MariaDB Connector J (reference: MariaDB/mariadb-connector-j@de8883b).
So some code is added to make sure ProxySQL can be applied to the read-write split on Azure MySQL Servers in the future.","@funkyfundev : the mysql_azure_enabled has been removed (link) after discussion with my colleagues because the new connection attribute _server_host has no effect on the connection with non-azure databases. In other words, this attribute is transmitted by default when ProxySQL connecting database. You don't need extra configuration.
However, besides the change on ProxySQL, it also needs fix support on Azure (as I said above). The fix has just been deployed in the servers in some certain regions, and is not available in a production environment yet. So, you cannot use ProxySQL on Azure databases now. But I believe it will be online soon.
If you need more help, please let me know.
Thanks :)

I really like the idea!
Unfortunately it is unlikely that this will be merged into 2.0.x , because it changes the number of columns in mysql_query_rules , and we try really hard to not change the tables definitions of the tables involved in ProxySQL Cluster in 2.0.x.
This is for compatibility reasons: a ProxySQL instance 2.0.x should be able to sync with an instance 2.0.y .
For this reason, this PR will be on hold until 2.1 . Does it make sense?
Another option would be to merge it into 2.0 , but our release note should be extremely clear that it breaks compatibility with previous releases: this is not an easy decision.
On the same topic, this PR doesn't handle sync using ProxySQL Cluster: this is expected, because it cannot sync for the reason listed above. Yet, it needs to be addressed.",True,{}

Thank you for the PR!
I couldn't find this detail in AWS documentation:

Aurora instances that have been deleted still exist in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.REPLICA_HOST_STATUS table, but with a REPLICA_LAG_IN_MILLISECONDS set to 900000.

Instead of filtering the specific value 900000, does it sound reasonable to filter any value greater than a specific one?
Because mysql_aws_aurora_hostgroups has:
max_lag_ms INT NOT NULL CHECK (max_lag_ms>= 10 AND max_lag_ms <= 600000) DEFAULT 600000

instead of adding AND REPLICA_LAG_IN_MILLISECONDS != 900000 we could add AND REPLICA_LAG_IN_MILLISECONDS <= 600000.

table definition bug
window size increased up to 16 log entries

Implements:

upgrade functionality for mysql_aws_aurora_hostgroups table
add new column estimated_lag_ms to mysql_server_aws_aurora_log`

Tested with SQLite3_Server, with different window sizes (1, 5, 16)
Values in the estimated_lag_ms column tested with the query:
mysql> select hostname, port, time_start_us, success_time_us, server_id, session_id, last_update_timestamp, server_id, session_id, replica_lag_in_milliseconds, max((replica_lag_in_milliseconds + 10),20) lag, estimated_lag_ms, cpu from mysql_server_aws_aurora_log where server_id like '%2.12%' order by time_start_us limit 20;

The following is the coredump（write (this=0x2b67402fd1f0, f=0x0, sess=0x2b67414a8c00)）:

And then i add a line of code in log_request function of MySQL_Logger.cpp file to check up whether events.logfile is null pointer ，as follow:
void MySQL_Logger::log_request(MySQL_Session *sess, MySQL_Data_Stream *myds) {
if (events.enabled==false) return;
if (events.logfile==NULL) return;
proxy_info(""log_request: First: events.logfile is null %d\n"", (events.logfile == NULL) ? 1 : 0);
MySQL_Connection_userinfo *ui=sess->client_myds->myconn->userinfo;

And i make a benchmark test  again with proxysql 2.0.8 debug version, the coredump of proxysql happen again, then i get the follow print info from proxysql.log

Impact of this fix：
I analyzed the call relationship of write_auth function of MySQL_Logger.cpp file  in the whole project of proxysql with the source insight ide. I found write_auth function  that was only called by the write function of MySQL_Logger.cpp file in the whole project of proxysql,  and this write function was only called by log_audit_entry function or log_request function of  MySQL_Logger.cpp file in the whole project of proxysql. However, i've added a mutex lock separately in log_audit_entry function and log_request function. And so i think it should delete the code for the wrlock function call in write_auth function, and it doesn't have impact for this time fix.

2019-12-06 11:03:34 main.cpp:1397:ProxySQL_daemonize_phase3(): [INFO] ProxySQL version _DEBUG
Impact of this fix：
I analyzed the call relationship of write_auth function of MySQL_Logger.cpp file  in the whole project of proxysql with the source insight ide. I found write_auth function  that was only called by the write function of MySQL_Logger.cpp file in the whole project of proxysql,  and this write function was only called by log_audit_entry function or log_request function of  MySQL_Logger.cpp file in the whole project of proxysql. However, i've added a mutex lock separately in log_audit_entry function and log_request function. And so i think it should delete the code for the wrlock function call in write_auth function, and it doesn't have impact for this time fix.
Bux fix:
Fix add a mutex lock twice in the process of function call(log_audit_entry() -> write() -> write_auth())",Thank you for the new PR and for the fix!,True,{}

Restapi endpoint feature allows users to create new RESTapi endpoints and execute scripts on behalf of the proxysql. At the moment there are two examples of the scripts that are used for querying memory metrics and exporting users from MySQL database to ProxySQL.
Installing dependencies
The python package mysqlclient must be installed in order export_users package to work. This can be accomplished by the pip command:
$ pip install mysqlclient

or, if proxysql is running under sudo:
$ sudo pip install mysqlclient

Creating new endpoint
In order to create a new RESTapi endpoint, it must be defined in the restapi_routes table.
MySQL [(none)]> select * from restapi_routes;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

admin-restapi_enabled is an admin variable, but you are trying to configure it in the mysql_variables. I tried to configure
admin_variables=

Restapi endpoint feature allows users to create new RESTapi endpoints and execute scripts on behalf of the proxysql. At the moment there are two examples of the scripts that are used for querying memory metrics and exporting users from MySQL database to ProxySQL.
Installing dependencies
The python package mysqlclient must be installed in order export_users package to work. This can be accomplished by the pip command:
$ pip install mysqlclient

or, if proxysql is running under sudo:
$ sudo pip install mysqlclient

In order to create a new RESTapi endpoint, it must be defined in the restapi_routes table.

This relies on ProxySQL tracking GTID of each backend, using https://github.com/sysown/proxysql_mysqlbinlog. That must be running on each MySQL host.
Each client keeps min_gtid of the data that it has written (maybe even leveraging session_track_gtids): in a cookie/session for web requests, and in Redis for batch jobs.
min_gtid is passed in a comment to ProxySQL, which lets it choose any read replica that satisfies that GTID.

#2444 (comment) has a diagram showing how that can be leveraged by a typical web app.

It accomplishes this by adding a new column to mysql_servers table called connection_warming. This column serves as a config option for that backend.
Defaults value is 0 meaning connection warming disabled. When set to 1 for a particular backend, it forces ProxySQL to open new connections until the expected number of warm connections is reached.
The expected number of warm connections is calculated based on mysql-free_connection_pct value. For eg: if max_connections is set to 100 and mysql-free_connection_pct is set to 50, then if connection_warming is enabled for a backend server, then it will open and keep 50 connections warm at all time.
This PR doesn't let ProxySQL open new connections on its own, but uses the incoming MySQL connection requests to do so. This approach should help in creating and maintaining connections that are set to application-specific session information as well hence increasing the utilization of the connection pool.
The addition of a new column to mysql_servers table could very well be a breaking change, hence there are chances that this PR may not get merged in the current versions of ProxySQL.","This PR adds support for connection warming per backend server.

If none of the replica are in sync, the request should go to the writer instead of giving up.

Right, that's what the current design of ProxySQL r/w split assumes.
From my perspective, the behavior you want depends on the workload. If it's online workload (a web request), then you'd rather send it to writer than fail it. If it's a batch processing workload (a background job) that can be processed now or later, then you don't necessarily want to overload writer with something that can get processed later.
In the current scheme, you can implement a r/w split that would do best effort routing to replicas if they are caught up - and if not, send queries to the writer. However, that's a very easy way to crash the writer with even more queries when things are unhealthy.
Maybe the answer is that for batch processing, it shouldn't even hit ProxySQL to check for GTID in the first place, and should somehow else discover that replicas are delayed. But since ProxySQL already does GTID tracking and discovery, I was very eager to [mis]use it to get that data into that app.

Hi!  Our situation is that we are using a Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate that is signed by the X3 intermediary of the ISRG X1 root.  Based on my own personal testing I was not able to get clients to properly connect to a ProxySQL instance with TLS enabled and the standard set of CA certificates.  I was only able to get working connections after either altering the client's CA bundle, altering the client's CA/TLS settings directly, or using the patch I provided.
I am not a TLS expert but it has always been my understanding that while root certificates are installed on the system, intermediate certificates are generally distributed by services during connection negotiation.  The intent of this change was to enable this behavior by providing the SSL context with the certificate chain which includes certificates that are not in the system bundle.
To be a little more generic, what I need is the ability to build a Docker container with a Go program installed along with the standard certificate bundle and have TLS connections work without having to install extra certificates or modifying the source of the Go program.  The changes I have provided make this possible for me but if there is a better way to accomplish this then I am open to suggestions.",True,{}

So, after discussing the current behavior of certificates added to the certificate chain, we have decided that we are going to add the root certificate by default, this is because after further investigation we have found that mysql also adds the root certificate to the certificate chain, so, for honoring that behavior, we are going to do the same. This means that this PR matches this new desired approach for the SSL chain. I'm going to review and merge it. Thanks!",True,{}

Adds support for CLIENT_DEPRECATE_EOF flag to communicate with clients.

The EOF packet after FieldMetadata packets are no longer present.
And the EOF packet after ResultSet is replaced by an OK packet with header FE.

I have few comments and questions:
Why did you made commit 7f5fc68 ? I believe that using the default value seems to be a better approach, especially to minimize the changes.
Hardcoding CLIENT_DEPRECATE_EOF in commit 555ff4c is not the best approach. The feature should be configurable, especially to avoid compatibility issues. A better approach is to have it as a global variable: see the example for CLIENT_SSL in commit 5863d9c.
Although I didn't try it yet, this feature should break query cache if there is a mix of clients using or not using CLIENT_DEPRECATE_EOF , therefore we need to fix that too.
Furthermore, we made the decision to not add any new feature in 2.0 , but only bug fixes.
New features should go into 2.1 .
If this feature didn't have potential compatibility issues, it could have been an exception and be added in 2.0. But I suspect it is an important feature with possible drawbacks: what do you think?",True,{}

Why did you made commit 7f5fc68 ? I believe that using the default value seems to be a better approach, especially to minimize the changes.

In an internal review feedback, I was told that the function already takes around ~10 parameters and adding a new one with default parameter makes it harder to look into all the places where the change might be necessary. And that in future, if a new parameter needs to be added, it gets difficult. Which I think is a good feedback.

Hardcoding CLIENT_DEPRECATE_EOF in commit 555ff4c is not the best approach. The feature should be configurable, especially to avoid compatibility issues. A better approach is to have it as a global variable: see the example for CLIENT_SSL in commit 5863d9c.

Hum good point. I can get this fixed.

Although I didn't try it yet, this feature should break query cache if there is a mix of clients using or not using CLIENT_DEPRECATE_EOF , therefore we need to fix that too.

Can you point where in code this might cause problem? I can dig into it too.

Do you have a general idea when you'll get to 2.1? There are really no breaking changes so we can have it in 2.0 as well if 2.1 will take long time.
We've been able to run ProxySQL with these commits locally without any issues so the transition has been pretty smooth but we don't use mixed clients as you mentioned in your feedback.",True,{}

@renecannao","Hi @saunderst , thank you for rebasing!
I will review.
To answer your questions:

It looks as though to change MySQL_Thread::get_MyConn_local() correctly, we'd have to instantiate the MySrvList class and reproduce the hash-based selection logic before checking against the cached connections.

To instantiate the MySrvList you need to access the global connection pool. Accessing the global connection pool (protected by a mutex) is exactly what per-thread connection caching tries to avoid, therefore accessing MySrvList will void the benefit of per-thread connection caching.

I'm curious, though: Why did my tests never fail? Is connection caching disabled by default?

Connections caching is enabled by default, and there is no way to disable it.
Connections stay in per-thread connection cache for a very short period of time: every MySQL_Thread works returns the connections in the cache back into the global connection pool as soon as it finishes processing sessions in every iteration of the main loop:
https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/blob/v2.0.13/lib/MySQL_Thread.cpp#L4021-L4023
In other words, the per-thread connections cache becomes useful only at very high concurrency and very fast requests: in this scenario it is likely that a backend connection freed is immediately used by another session, within the same iteration of the MySQL_Thread main loop.
You can have a look at these 2 variables:
SELECT * FROM stats_mysql_global WHERE variable_name IN ('ConnPool_get_conn_immediate','ConnPool_get_conn_success');

ConnPool_get_conn_immediate counts how many times a connection was retrieved from the per-thread connection cache.
Depending from your workload, it is possible that per-thread connection cache is never/rarely used.",True,{'THUMBS_UP': ['https://github.com/saunderst']}

Opps, I thought it was about ""select"" global like:

or:
SELECT @@session.auto_increment_increment AS auto_increment_increment, @@character_set_client AS character_set_client, @@character_set_connection AS character_set_connection, @@character_set_results AS character_set_results, @@character_set_server AS character_set_server, @@init_connect AS init_connect, @@interactive_timeout AS interactive_timeout, @@license AS license, @@lower_case_table_names AS lower_case_table_names, @@max_allowed_packet AS max_allowed_packet, @@net_buffer_length AS net_buffer_length, @@net_write_timeout AS net_write_timeout, @@query_cache_size AS query_cache_size, @@query_cache_type AS query_cache_type, @@sql_mode AS sql_mode, @@system_time_zone AS system_time_zone, @@time_zone AS time_zone, @@tx_isolation AS tx_isolation, @@wait_timeout AS wait_timeout

We have many types of clients, and every client running other initial connection, i added query rule to solve this issue:

added link to https://proxysql.com/contact-us/ for the ""contact us"" part of that; I'm not sure if that's what you want people to use?

https://serge.frezefond.com/2020/06/using-proxysql-with-azure-database-for-mysql-mariadb/","@sfrezefo : thank you for the PR.
This reminds me PR #2185 .
In August 2019 (10 months ago) it was reported:

Now Azure MySQL R&Ds are doing the work of removing the ‘@' + 'server' in the username information, which will be online soon. However, a new connection attribute '_server_host' which contains the hostname information is added

It seems that after 10 months  this isn't true yet?
Ping to @YYJiangLoveU too.
@sfrezefo : I am curious about the use of the variable name, why gen1 in it?
A major issue I see with this implementation is that the use of username@hostname becomes a global setting, therefore it is not possible to mix Azure with any other backend type.
Ideally, this should be a hostgroup attribute , but the implementation of such granularity it is not on short term roadmap ( #955 , 3 years old ) .
Maybe the new global variable (azure_gen1_username or a more appropriate name based on the suggested change) should not be a boolean, but a list of hostgroups where the algorithm must be applied.
Internally the list can be stored as a simple array (not even sorted, it should stay small).
Thoughts?",True,{}

https://serge.frezefond.com/2020/06/using-proxysql-with-azure-database-for-mysql-mariadb/","Hi René,
Thank for looking at the PR.
As you mentioned engineering has plan to offer an alternative architecture without the gateway. This is not yet there and we have  a lot of gen1 user that could benefit from proxySQL .
This explained why I proposed a azure_gen1_username.  But any naming that you think is more appropriate would be ok . Naming stuff is a difficult task in dev ;-)
The point you raised about the granularity of this feature makes a lot of sense. The granularity of the effect of this feature is a real choice and is a compromise between simplicity of usage and support of more diverse configurations.
Currently with Azure Database for MySQL it is possible to replicate from non Paas instance to a Paas instance (including from on premise or hybrid cloud) https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/concepts-data-in-replication .
I think a simpler way to achieve the same result as what you proposed without introducing list and per hostgroup feature would be to use a very simple rule :
if azure_gen1_username == 1 and the target hostname contains 'mysql.database.azure.com' or 'mariadb.database.azure.com'
rewrite the username. otherwise do nothing
That would cover all cases as it wont touch username not related to Azure Database for MySQL / MariaDB.  In that case azure_gen1_username semantic would be : rewrite username when target is an azure paas database and for the rest do nothing. This will allow mixing any kind of backend types.
thanks for your help

client connections.  This allows the true client IP to be seen in the output
of SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST in ProxySQL's admin frontend when the ProxySQL
servers sit behind a load balancer such as HAProxy or AWS classic ELBs with
the PROXY protocol feature enabled.
I believe this should resolve #2497 (Support for proxy_protocol for proxysql behind aws load balancer).
The patch adds a Proxy_Protocol class which handles:

parsing of PROXY protocol headers (only the V1 header supported for now)
matching client IPs against a list of configured network CIDRs

A new option, proxy_protocol_frontend_nets (list of network CIDRs), is
introduced to allow the PROXY protocol feature to be selectively turned on for
specific subnets where e.g. load balancers are running.  This is similar to how
the PROXY protocol is implemented in MariaDB.
This variable can be set either in the config file or via the ProxySQL Admin
interface.  Configuration file example:
mysql_variables=
{
    ...
    proxy_protocol_frontend_nets=""10.42.0.0/28 127.10.0.0/16""
    ...
}

ProxySQL Admin interface example:
UPDATE global_variables
SET variable_value=""192.168.42.0/24""
WHERE variable_name=""mysql-proxy_protocol_frontend_nets"";
LOAD MYSQL VARIABLES TO RUNTIME;

The network CIDRs are stored as a thread-local variable in the MySQL_Thread
class.  It's only updated by MySQL_Thread::refresh_variables().
A new MySQL Data Stream state (DSS), STATE_PROXY_PROTOCOL, is introduced to
handle the initial parsing of the PROXY protocol header.  Once this has
completed, the state is reset back to STATE_SERVER_HANDSHAKE.
The patch hooks into the MySQL_Thread's main loop where accept() is called
to handle incoming connections.  Next, the actual parsing of the PROXY protocol
header is invoked from the MySQL_Data_Stream::read_pkts() method, which is
also called from MySQL_Thread's main loop (where incoming data is handled).
I've only tested this with a HAProxy configuration block like:
listen proxysql-with-proxy
    bind *:6030
    option tcp-check
    mode tcp
    timeout server 6h
    timeout client 6h
    balance roundrobin
    server proxysql-backend-1 127.0.0.1:6033 check send-proxy
listen proxysql-without-proxy
    bind *:6031
    option tcp-check
    mode tcp
    timeout server 6h
    timeout client 6h
    balance roundrobin

I have been trying to reproduce the issue you describe with your provided scripts, I have tried with several versions of ProxySQL (including v2.0.16 and v2.0.14), for being sure I left the scripts running 45 min with each version, I haven't had any luck so far.
Secondly, this PR has too many changes in it, typically we stick to one PR, on issue, if the goal of this PR is to fix a data-race, will be much more simpler to analyze it, if only packs the absolute minimum to fix it. Also, because this is for sure a timing issue, and looks like maybe wont be easy to reproduce in our side, If you are sure that the data-race you are experiencing is solved with this PR, could you please describe more deeply which one do you think are the causes of it?, i.e:

I don't have a complete log of this but I guess it's more flexible to get the log from the script to reproduce the problem, if this is not enough let me know I'll add a log.","Hi, about the PR we were having several problems using ProxySQL with Galera because it didn't correctly use the priority of the nodes after a fail-over, so after investigating it I narrowed down the problem to race conditions and after reviewing the code I discovered several problems in the code corresponding to the monitoring.
Regarding the code involved I would say that is all that appears in the review and I don't think it's easy to divide even more the review with the time I have available, basically the problems that I found are:

The hostgroups manager code is not atomic since the state may change while a check is running, an example could be the call to the commit function, which acquires a mutex, and the subsequent acquisition of the same again without taking into account that the state may have changed in the meantime. To solve this, I added a commit_locked function and the mutex is acquired during all the check code.
The ProxySQL admin code update and delete several sqlite results without obtaining a mutex so other threads may continue using a nonexistent structure in the meantime. To solve this I change it to obtain the mutex during the process and also I used the commit_locked function.
In some places the administration DB is consulted in the monitoring code instead the internal one, which is incorrect and by not using mutexes it has race conditions. To solve it I changed it with the internal one.
The code used to decide if it is necessary to update the servers does not take into account if the server is offline since it has to continue maintaining the internal DB row until it has no more connections because the only place where the pointer to it is stored is the internal DB. To solve this, I added a special list with all the servers that are offline and a variable to indicate if the mysql_servers table is dirty and it is necessary to reconstruct it.

I understand it's a big review but I think it's necessary to avoid headaches in general and especially for people who use Galera. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
As a note, since we started using this patch in production a couple of months ago we haven't had any more problems with fail-over in production although, unfortunately, I don't have the resources to review in depth the changes that are not Galera related.",True,"{'HEART': ['https://github.com/lots0logs'], 'ROCKET': ['https://github.com/lots0logs']}"

The change to the unregister code removes this unexpected addition but I don't like the idea of assuming that the right session is being removed by an index. For now I have pushed up a change that verifies it is removing the same session it added.

Primary changes

A NativeEnvironment that renders Python types instead of strings.
http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/nativetypes/
A namespace object that works with {% set %}. This replaces
previous hacks for storing state across iterations or scopes.
http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#assignments
The loop object now has nextitem and previtem attributes, as
well as a changed method, for the common case of outputting
something as a value in the loop changes. More complicated cases can
use the namespace object.

Changelog

Added a new extension node called OverlayScope which can be used to create an unoptimized scope that will look up all variables from a derived context.
Added an in test that works like the in operator.  This can be used in combination with reject and select.
Added previtem and nextitem to loop contexts, providing access to the previous/next item in the loop. If such an item does not exist, the value is undefined.
Added changed(*values) to loop contexts, providing an easy way of checking whether a value has changed since the last iteration (or rather since the last call of the method)
Added a namespace function that creates a special object which allows attribute assignment using the set tag.  This can be used to carry data across scopes, e.g. from a loop body to code that comes after the loop.
Added a trimmed modifier to {% trans %} to strip linebreaks and surrounding whitespace. Also added a new policy to enable this for all trans blocks.
The random filter is no longer incorrectly constant folded and will produce a new random choice each time the template is rendered. (#478)
Added a unique filter. (#469)
Added min and max filters. (#475)
Added tests for all comparison operators: eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge. (#665)
import statement cannot end with a trailing comma. (#617, #618)
indent filter will not indent blank lines by default. (#685)

Version 2.10.1
Released 2019-04-06

SandboxedEnvironment securely handles str.format_map in
order to prevent code execution through untrusted format strings.
The sandbox already handled str.format.

Version 2.10
Released 2017-11-08

Added a new extension node called OverlayScope which can be used
to create an unoptimized scope that will look up all variables from
a derived context.
Added an in test that works like the in operator. This can be
used in combination with reject and select.
Added previtem and nextitem to loop contexts, providing
access to the previous/next item in the loop. If such an item does
not exist, the value is undefined.
Added changed(*values) to loop contexts, providing an easy way
of checking whether a value has changed since the last iteration (or
rather since the last call of the method)
Added a namespace function that creates a special object which
allows attribute assignment using the set tag. This can be used
to carry data across scopes, e.g. from a loop body to code that
comes after the loop.
Added a trimmed modifier to {% trans %} to strip linebreaks
and surrounding whitespace. Also added a new policy to enable this
for all trans blocks.
The random filter is no longer incorrectly constant folded and
will produce a new random choice each time the template is rendered.

Added an in test that works like the in operator.  This can be used in combination with reject and select.
Added previtem and nextitem to loop contexts, providing access to the previous/next item in the loop. If such an item does not exist, the value is undefined.
Added changed(*values) to loop contexts, providing an easy way of checking whether a value has changed since the last iteration (or rather since the last call of the method)
Added a namespace function that creates a special object which allows attribute assignment using the set tag.  This can be used to carry data across scopes, e.g. from a loop body to code that comes after the loop.
Added a trimmed modifier to {% trans %} to strip linebreaks and surrounding whitespace. Also added a new policy to enable this for all trans blocks.
The random filter is no longer incorrectly constant folded and will produce a new random choice each time the template is rendered. (#478)
Added a unique filter. (#469)
Added min and max filters. (#475)
Added tests for all comparison operators: eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge. (#665)
import statement cannot end with a trailing comma. (#617, #618)
indent filter will not indent blank lines by default. (#685)
Add reverse argument for dictsort filter. (#692)
Add a NativeEnvironment that renders templates to native Python types instead of strings. (#708)
Added filter support to the block set tag. (#489)
tojson filter marks output as safe to match documented behavior. (#718)
Resolved a bug where getting debug locals for tracebacks could modify template context.
Fixed a bug where having many {% elif ... %} blocks resulted in a ""too many levels of indentation"" error.  These blocks now compile to native elif ..: instead of else: if ..: (#759)

Version 2.10.1
Released 2019-04-06

SandboxedEnvironment securely handles str.format_map in
order to prevent code execution through untrusted format strings.
The sandbox already handled str.format.

It seems that:

if during mysql_real_connect() the backend cannot set the collation asked by the client (for example if the client is mysql 8 asking for utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci while the backend is mysql 5.7 and doesn't support utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci), the backend silently sets it to its own default
if during mysql_change_user() the backend cannot set the collation asked by the client, it returns error Access denied and also (using password: NO)

This PR allows ProxySQL's query rules to be in dry run mode. When a rule is in dry run mode, the rule would not actually perform its action, it would simply log matched queries and the action that would have been taken. Once an author is confident that their rule is working correctly, they can change the rule from dry run mode to active mode, where the rule would actually take action.
This PR only adds dry run modes for reject, rewrite, and reroute rules (error_msg, replace_pattern, destination_hostgroup).
Here is what query rule modes would look like:

If this method of defining dry run query rules is not preferred, an alternative solution would be to add a  dryrun column.
An additional field has been added to query logging output only in JSON mode. The field is called query_rule_info, and contains a JSON blob potentially containing the following sub-fields (some or all may be present):
query_rule_id: id in the mysql_query_rules table
query_rule_active: ""true"" or ""false"", based on active in the mysql_query_rules table
original_query: if the rule is active and pattern replacement has been done, this is the original query before replacement
rewritten_query: if the rule is active and pattern replacement has been done, this is the query executed
dry_run_original_query: if the rule is inactive and pattern replacement would be done, this is the original query before replacement
dry_run_rewritten_query: if the rule is inactive and pattern replacement would be done, this would be the new query after replacement
This is what example JSON would look like:

Additional logging enhancement that can be broken up into a separate PR:
This PR also adds the ability to log to stderr. You would simply set eventslog_format=3 in mysql_variables through proxysql.cnf or the admin console. This makes viewing logs much easier than going through a file and will avoid any issues that come with filling up the disk when writing logs to a file.
The logs will only happen on the nth query matching each rule, where n is any power of 2. If this behaviour isn't desired, it can be removed or put behind a variable that will let users choose whether they want logs to happen all the time or only on powers of 2.

When set this parameter max_replication_lag(mysql_servers)  > monitor_slave_lag_when_null , and if this slave seconds_behind_master is null,  this server status is online in the proxysql.
Test situation：
when  set max_replication_lag =70 in the server(IP: 192.168.10.12),  and max_replication_lag > monitor_slave_lag_when_null(default value: 60), and this server status is online.  Howerver the seconds_behind_master(sbm) of this slave server(192.168.10.12) is null, and this proxysql should set  the server status shunned.

**bux and problems fix: **
Based on issue #3288, #3290,  add a parameter monitor_sbm_when_null_algorithm，when max_replication_lag > monitor_slave_lag_when_null， solve the correct setting of the status of the slave server that seconds_behind_master of this server is null.
The parameter monitor_sbm_when_null_algorithm：
True--     when seconds_behind_master(sbm) is null, use new algorithm,
False --- use monitor_slave_lag_when_null, backward compatible.",Automated message: PR pending admin approval for build testing,True,{}

ProxySQL itself will simulate hundreds of backends across hundreds of
hostgroups, all configured in hundreds of clusters, and return read_only
values for each of the simulated backend.
The read_only value can be configured in table READONLY_STATUS available in
the SQLite3Server module.
If a backend isn't configured in table READONLY_STATUS , its default read_only
value is 1.
It is possible to simulate a lot of simultaneous failover running queries like
the following:
UPDATE READONLY_STATUS SET read_only=1;
CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT hostname FROM READONLY_STATUS ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 50;
UPDATE READONLY_STATUS SET read_only=0 WHERE hostname IN (SELECT hostname FROM t1);

I reviewed the TAP test, and it seems it only verifies that the connections was successful.
What is checked in https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/pull/3505/files#diff-c1e730848ba50f784c953774083d77fe5b5e26704f6fb72260950bb0910423c2R104-R111 is that (exp_switching_auth_type == act_switching_auth_type) && (exp_SSL_val == act_SSL_val) .
If CHANGE_USER fails (the whole purpose of this fix/PR/tap) , err_msg is set (https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/pull/3505/files#diff-6b80bab0fae2be3edf5d9f9711f6645372823fd7dad6c705f858fe9748140a86R196-R200) but nothing verifies it.
In other words, it seems the tap tests doesn't verify what it should be verifying.

is handled.
Old behavior
Servers which lag is above the threshold determined by
'mysql-groupreplication_max_transactions_behind_count' and had read_only=1

New behavior
Servers which lag is above the threshold determined by
'mysql-groupreplication_max_transactions_behind_count' are 'SHUNNED' depending
on the value of the new introduced variable:
'mysql-monitor_groupreplication_max_transaction_behind_for_read_only'.
This variable has three possible values:

'0': Only servers with read_only=0 are placed as 'SHUNNED'.
'1': Only servers with read_only=1 are placed as 'SHUNNED' (default).
'2': Both servers with read_only=1 and read_only=0 are placed as 'SHUNNED'.

In addition to this behavior regarding to actions when 'groupreplication_max_transactions_behind_count'
is exceeded by a server. Now it's also possible to set severs configured as writers
in 'OFFLINE_SOFT' state, while preserving the server in the 'writer_hostgroup'.
For achieve this behavior, simply set a server which is configured as a 'writer'
i.e. the server 'hostgroup_id' is the 'writer_hostgroup', and set it's state to
be 'OFFLINE_SOFT', after this, issue a 'LOAD MYSQL SERVERS TO RUNTIME'. The
server should be preserved in the writer hostgroup but it's status should change
to 'OFFLINE_SOFT'.

is handled.
Old behavior
Servers which lag is above the threshold determined by
'mysql-groupreplication_max_transactions_behind_count' and had read_only=1
were set 'OFFLINE' until replication catch up.
New behavior
Servers which lag is above the threshold determined by
'mysql-groupreplication_max_transactions_behind_count' are 'SHUNNED' depending
on the value of the new introduced variable:
'mysql-monitor_groupreplication_max_transaction_behind_for_read_only'.
This variable has three possible values:

'0': Only servers with read_only=0 are placed as 'SHUNNED'.
'1': Only servers with read_only=1 are placed as 'SHUNNED' (default).
'2': Both servers with read_only=1 and read_only=0 are placed as 'SHUNNED'.

In addition to this behavior regarding to actions when 'groupreplication_max_transactions_behind_count'
is exceeded by a server. Now it's also possible to set severs configured as writers
in 'OFFLINE_SOFT' state, while preserving the server in the 'writer_hostgroup'.
For achieve this behavior, simply set a server which is configured as a 'writer'
i.e. the server 'hostgroup_id' is the 'writer_hostgroup', and set it's state to
be 'OFFLINE_SOFT', after this, issue a 'LOAD MYSQL SERVERS TO RUNTIME'. The
server should be preserved in the writer hostgroup but it's status should change
to 'OFFLINE_SOFT'.

For single master mode, there are more scenarios for using single master mode.  And when the slave server is in a state where the delay exceeds the threshold,  proxysql will immediately offline the slave server.

This change is performed, without afecting to any current transactions

I think I get your point, and I absolutely agree with the problem you are pointing at.
Although, I think OFFLINE_SOFT is not the right approach.
Let me explain.
OFFLINE_SOFT is a configuration state, and a server in this state is configured to not be used for new connections, but not only...
SHUNNED is instead a temporary status from which the server should automatically recover.
In other words, a server shouldn't automatically go from OFFLINE_SOFT to ONLINE , but should automatically go from SHUNNED to ONLINE.
In fact, PR #3473 would conflict with what said previously: a server in OFFLINE_SOFT should never be returned to ONLINE automatically (and this is now implemented in PR #3533).

And when the slave server is in a state where the delay exceeds the threshold, proxysql will immediately offline the slave server. I think this is inappropriate, because it will interrupt the business and cause the program to report an error.

This is by design.
All the details are here: #774
We could set status to MYSQL_SERVER_STATUS_SHUNNED instead of MYSQL_SERVER_STATUS_SHUNNED_REPLICATION_LAG .
This will solve the issue of connections being closed immediately, but hostgroup manager automatically tries to bring a server back online from shunned, no matter if replication lag is still present or not: this is why MYSQL_SERVER_STATUS_SHUNNED_REPLICATION_LAG exists and is different than state MYSQL_SERVER_STATUS_SHUNNED .
Thinking about a possible solution, we could implement a mechanism in which a node is first configured as MYSQL_SERVER_STATUS_SHUNNED and then MYSQL_SERVER_STATUS_SHUNNED_REPLICATION_LAG if replication lag doesn't recover quickly.
The state MYSQL_SERVER_STATUS_SHUNNED_REPLICATION_LAG should be set within a short period of time after MYSQL_SERVER_STATUS_SHUNNED because otherwise the node could go ONLINE while it shouldn't.",True,{}

Old behavior
Servers which lag is above the threshold determined by

'0': Only servers with read_only=0 are placed as 'SHUNNED'.

Now we want to set the writer '127.2.1.2' to OFFLINE_SOFT, so we simply set it
via ProxySQL Admin:
UPDATE mysql_servers SET status='OFFLINE_SOFT' WHERE hostname='127.2.1.2';

And we load mysql_servers to runtime:
LOAD MYSQL SERVERS TO RUNTIME

The runtime_mysql_servers table should transition to the following state:
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

This change is performed, without afecting to any current transactions
behind executed in the server that have placed as 'OFFLINE_SOFT'. For making the
server operational again, it's required just to set it again to 'ONLINE' state.","@renecannao , PR dd71fcd,  I think
the code is too complicated and this is to complicate simple things.  Because for the program, do not interrupt its connection due to the delay of the mysql slave until it catches up. And It may take a long time for the slave to catch up with the master, not for a while.  For example, when it comes to big transaction.",True,{}

ssl_capath


The ssl_capath option defines a path to a directory that contains one or more PEM files that should each contain one X509 certificate for a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

This is a change we are running in our production environment at Shopify.
In a self-managed SSL architecture, particularly in a large-scale infrastructure intranet in our case, CRLs allow explicitly revoking certificates before their expiration date, while specifying multiple CAs would allow us to rotate our certificates without having to rebuild all our infrastructure from scratch.
The actual changes here are fairly trivial as they use the currently-existing options on the MySQL client library. For a reference to review against, please see the MySQL C API section on Support for Encrypted Connections, where the functions mysql_options() and mysql_set_ssl() functions are well-described.
Below are helpful descriptions of the feature from the mariadb documentation.

ssl_capath


The ssl_capath option defines a path to a directory that contains one or more PEM files that should each contain one X509 certificate for a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). This option requires that you use the absolute path, not a relative path. The ssl_capath option is only supported if the server or client was built with OpenSSL, wolfSSL, or yaSSL. If the client was built with GnuTLS or Schannel, then the ssl_capath option is not supported.


ssl_{crl,crlpath}


Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) are lists of certificates that have been revoked by the Certificate Authority (CA) before they were due to expire.
CRLs are specified on the server and client by using the ssl_crl and ssl_crlpath options.


The ssl_crl option defines a path to a PEM file that should contain one or more X509 revoked certificates. This option requires that you use the absolute path, not a relative path. For servers, the ssl_crl option is only valid if the server was built with OpenSSL. If the server was built with wolfSSL or yaSSL, then the ssl_crl option is not supported. For clients, the ssl_crl option is only valid if the client was built with OpenSSL or Schannel.

'Client Error Limit' is a feature that limits  the number of connection errors that can be initiated from a particular address before denying future connections from that address.
Feature is controlled by new introduced variables:

mysql-client_host_error_counts: Determines the number of errors than a client address needs to reach before getting banned for future connections.
mysql-client_host_cache_size: Determines the size of the cache being used for keeping track of the clients addresses that have had any connection errors.
Command 'PROXYSQL FLUSH MYSQL CLIENT HOSTS': Clears the client host cache.

When enabled, the expected behavior for the cache is the following:
When a new connection arrives, the cache is check for knowing if the client address has reached the
maximum errors, if the limit has been reached, and error is printed in ProxySQL log advertising the
event. If the limit is not reached, the connection tries to be performed, the situation has now to
possible outcomes:

a) The connection fails, the client address is added to the cache if it wasn't present, otherwise,
   it's error count is increased. If the cache was full, the oldest entry will be replaced with one
   holding this client address.
b) The connection succeeds, if the client address was present in the cache, it's removed from it.

Two new tables has also been introduced for being able to inspect the client_host_cache :

During the feature testing an issue with the impl was discovered regarding particular timing conditions that lead to an stall in the 'MySQL_Thread' processing the session. This was solved by commit: a49433c and explained in this comment.
The issue can be trivially reproduced by using the following provided patch:
read_delay.patch.tar.gz

Issues fixed
1. Queries ending with comment without spaces doesn't get the comment removed properly.

2. Numbers in scientific notation are not properly parsed because exponent is camel sensitive.

Aside of these and other minor fixes found during development.
New configuration option
This PR introduces the new configuration variable 'query_digests_groups_grouping_limit'. When enabled together with 'query_digests_grouping_limit' performs a replacement of the groups pattern found described by 'query_digests_grouping_limit' when the number of groups exceeds the value imposed by 'query_digests_groups_grouping_limit'. Ex:

query_digests_grouping_limit: 1
query_digests_groups_grouping_limit: 2

Q: `INSERT INTO db.table (col1,col2,col3) VALUES (1,2,3),(3,5,6),(7,8,9) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col1 = VALUES(col2)`
D: `INSERT INTO db.table (col1,col2,col3) VALUES (?,...),(?,...),... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col1 = VALUES(col2)`

This enables a new level of compression for digests in which literal values are not relevant, this feature is disabled by default.
Improved testing tooling
Introduced a new test 'test_mysql_query_digests_stages-t.cpp' which supports multiple testing payloads formats for checking the behavior between the different parsing stages, and different configuration options.
A fuzzy testing solution using AFL++ was also included in the PR for checking the new implementation stability.","This PR provides a new implementation for query digests generation, address multiple issues with the current implementation, and provides a new configuration option for the digests:

New configuration option
This PR introduces the new configuration variable 'query_digests_groups_grouping_limit'. When enabled together with 'query_digests_grouping_limit' performs a replacement of the groups pattern found described by 'query_digests_grouping_limit' when the number of groups exceeds the value imposed by 'query_digests_groups_grouping_limit'. Ex:

query_digests_grouping_limit: 1
query_digests_groups_grouping_limit: 2

Q: `INSERT INTO db.table (col1,col2,col3) VALUES (1,2,3),(3,5,6),(7,8,9) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col1 = VALUES(col2)`
D: `INSERT INTO db.table (col1,col2,col3) VALUES (?,...),(?,...),... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col1 = VALUES(col2)`

This enables a new level of compression for digests in which literal values are not relevant, this feature is disabled by default.

New configuration option
This PR introduces the new configuration variable 'query_digests_groups_grouping_limit'. When enabled together with 'query_digests_grouping_limit' performs a replacement of the groups pattern found described by 'query_digests_grouping_limit' when the number of groups exceeds the value imposed by 'query_digests_groups_grouping_limit'. Ex:

query_digests_grouping_limit: 1
query_digests_groups_grouping_limit: 2

Q: `INSERT INTO db.table (col1,col2,col3) VALUES (1,2,3),(3,5,6),(7,8,9) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col1 = VALUES(col2)`
D: `INSERT INTO db.table (col1,col2,col3) VALUES (?,...),(?,...),... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col1 = VALUES(col2)`

This enables a new level of compression for digests in which literal values are not relevant, this feature is disabled by default.
Improved testing tooling
Introduced a new test 'test_mysql_query_digests_stages-t.cpp' which supports multiple testing payloads formats for checking the behavior between the different parsing stages, and different configuration options.
A fuzzy testing solution using AFL++ was also included in the PR for checking the new implementation stability.",retest this please.,True,{}

Issues fixed
1. Queries ending with comment without spaces doesn't get the comment removed properly.

Q: # random_comment\n select 1.1# final_comment   \n
D: select ?# final comment

2. Numbers in scientific notation are not properly parsed because exponent is camel sensitive.

Q: SELECT 1.2E3, 1.2E-3, -1.2E3, -1.2E-3
D: SELECT 12E3, 12E-?,-12E3,-12E-? 

3. For query grouping NULL values doesn't reset the grouping count, this leads to cases as described in
'Grouping section' limitations description.
4. Commas preceding NULL values are not properly replaced in the digest.
SELECT 7,null,null, null;
SELECT ?,?,?,null

5. Commas are currently not copied if a grouping query is taking place, this conflicts with possible NULL
values that can be found, but that won't be replaced if mysql-query_digests_replace_null is 0:

Thank you for the detailed analysis.
We should probably replace *(char *)(pkt->ptr+4)!=(char)0x16 with *(char *)(pkt->ptr+4)==(char)0x03 to make sure that this code is activated only for COM_QUERY .
Function handler___status_WAITING_CLIENT_DATA___STATE_SLEEP___MYSQL_COM_QUERY_qpo() was initially designed to only handle COM_QUERY (as the name suggests) but it is now also executed for COM_STMT_PREPARE and COM_STMT_EXECUTE.
This means that the same filtering needs to be applied also for LAST_INSERT_ID and @@IDENTITY  , and I also suspect that SET statements prepared/executed in prepared statements do not work as expected.",True,{}

Thank you for looking at my patch.  After reading your words and thinking about it further, I do agree we should check specifically for COM_QUERY and not exclude COM_STMT_PREPARE.  I have made that change and updated the other intercepted queries which follow the same pattern.  I'm not sure if any other client request packet could have matched the original conditionals, but if so they probably are not exepecting a COM_QUERY style response.
I looked at the SET code and didn't see a clear path there.  Perhaps it's not an issue?  adapting my test case I wasn't able to break things:

The if statement in 2018 didn't consider the query type, but only checked for specific length and a strcmp() of the SQL in question.  If the query matches the if statement then a hard-coded response packet is sent(with presumably a usable connection id) that appears to be the response packet for a COM_QUERY request.
The problem comes up because there is only a 1 byte difference in packets depending if the client makes that query as a query or a prepared statement.  At offset 4, a value of 0x3 is COM_QUERY and 0x16 is COM_STMT_PREPARE.  when a client sends COM_STMT_PREPARE, it's expecting a different response than what's coded in the intercept.  When the client receives the malformed(from it's perspective) response, it closes the connection.
I don't know if the returned client id in a prepared statement is useful, but at least in my case I can't control the SQL being used.  I'd argue this is no more incorrect than changing the SQL to SELECT  CONNECTION_ID()(with 2 spaces), which would cause the same behavior.  Below is some trivial ruby code to demonstrate the problem:
