That includes a successful PBUILD on the Mac platform for OMI.
Additionally, if you run PBUILD, you will get your shared libraries for the providers across all of our platforms. You should keep your Makefile changes to build the providers but revert the Makefile changes to stage them to the build shares. If you run PBUILD (and you must in order to check in), then each of the PBUILD machines will build the shared libraries as part of their build. You can copy them off and then you're all set.

(I guess you were seeing from review page: https://github.com/Microsoft/omi/pull/469/files, in fact, you can see the many ""Show outdated"" items in PR page: #469, all old review comments are there.)
I have commentted all PATH in installer conf, they are default values and works fine after commentted out.
The only PATH can be modify to new location is ""logfile"", I have updated it in section comment.
For ""NoTLS"" related setting, I have removed them, thanks.
Previous 3 questions:

If these are here, we need to verify they work, not just with default location, but if moved to a new location, does everything still work properly?
Jumping: None of the directory or file path moved to new location will work except ""logfile"", I have tried one by one to move to /tmp. OMI related binaries now are very depended, it doesn't work now!

I have got following errors when move things to /tmp:
/tmp/opt
/tmp/var/opt

2.We need to decide if we want to support moving all of these things?
Jumping: We don't support moving omi things anymore now except ""logfile"".
3.For things that we depend on (like the un-commented out lines, if we indeed still depend on them), they should probably be moved to a different section with a note to not change or system may not work properly.
Jumping: Yes, they should not be changed and should notice that in a section, I have updated them, thanks.

copy /etc/opt/omi/conf/omiserver.conf  to omiserver.conf, I don't know why this happen.
Generate omiagent.root.root.log and omiserver.log under /tmp
/var/opt/omi/log/miclient.log should be set by default omicli.conf
/var/opt/omi/log/*.trc files are trace logs, I don't know why it still use default path instead of my setting /tmp, that's a confuse here.
/var/opt/omi/log/omiserver.log is the old log, it is by design when omi started with installing.",True,{}

Removing the ENABLE_CLEARING flag doesn't fix the root cause, that the call chain within Strand_ScheduleAux is deleting a pointer that it doesn't own.
In debug builds, this problem is caught in InteractionProtocolHandler_Session_Connect which attempts to use the freed memory.  In release builds, the problem is caught when the owner of the memory attempts to free it resulting in a double free.
This is exactly what was happening the first time around and this PR (ba1958e) fixed that case.

We support this, and current cert are self-signed, if customer want to use their own Signed CA cert, then they will meet issue, this PR will help them go smoothly.


we load cert here: https://github.com/Microsoft/omi/blob/ba1958ec946fc7705550d4d78796d5719e54c2cd/Unix/http/http.c#L1660


I have tested on 2 platforms (CentOS7x64 and Ubuntu16.04x64), they works fine.


etc/omiserver.conf already have the setting: https://github.com/Microsoft/omi/blob/master/Unix/etc/omiserver.conf#L43, its value will be a relative path based on the path of current source code, you can run omiserver -p to check the values like below (only for debugging).

* * * * * [ \( ! -f /etc/opt/omi/creds/omi.keytab \) -o \( /etc/krb5.keytab -nt /etc/opt/omi/creds/omi.keytab \) ] && /opt/omi/bin/support/ktstrip /etc/krb5.keytab /etc/opt/omi/creds/omi.keytab

Also I think your check is insufficient to update a preexisting configuration
https://github.com/Microsoft/omi/blob/master/Unix/scripts/config_keytab_update.sh#L15
is true for the ""old"" crontab line and so it won't replace it with a new one if config_keytab_update.sh is run. Not sure if that is actually the workflow you use though :)",True,{}

like following steps:


run ""openssl s_client -tls1_1 -connect localhost:1270""


add ""NoTLSv1_1=true"" to omiserver.conf


restart omiserver


run ""openssl s_client -tls1_1 -connect localhost:1270""

The problem I saw was as follows:
InteractionProtocolHandler_Session_Connect calls WsmanClient_New_Connector with an allocated operation.  Before returning, the connection fails and the operation is freed.   This would be fine if WsmanClient_New_Connector returned a failing MI_RESULT  but it doesn't, it returns MI_RESULT_OK and the code assumes the operation is still a valid memory pointer.  As a result, the following line is executed:
if (operation->protocolConnection->protocol.wsman == NULL)
Since the operation has been freed, in debug builds, protocolConnection contains an invalid pointer value and we get a seg fault.  In release builds, we're accessing freed memory and it's state is indeterminate.
Even with the suggested changes, we'll get a seg fault because we'll be dereferencing a null pointer, protocolConnection.   If we add a protocolConnection null pointer check, we'll end up getting a random seg fault any time that memory block happens to get reused for something else.
The reliable fix needs to handle the case that operation itself has been freed.",True,{}

This change adds a reference count to the InteractionProtcolHandler_Operation structure to address the race condition between InteractionProtocolHandler_Operation_Strand_Finish and InteractionProtocolHandler_Session_CommonInstanceCode.
For connection errors, the operation instance was being freed before returning to InteractionProtocolHandler_Session_Connect. This resulted in Session_Connect referencing a stale instance pointer and, later, a double free to occur on the operation instance.
The fix is as follows:
1: Set the reference count to 2 when the operation created

1 refcount ensures the lifetime is valid until control is returned to InteractionProtocolHandler_Session_CommonInstanceCode
1 refcount is for Strand_Finish to use when releasing the operation.

2: Remove the PAL_Free(operation) call from the error path in InteractionProtocolHandler_Operation_Close. This was causing a double free in error paths.
For error paths, the final release occurs in CommonInstanceCode since Finish has already been called.
For success paths, the final release typically occurs in Finish sometime after CommonInstanceCode has released it's reference.","Fix #502

This change places management of the session cookie in the HttpClient layer.  There are four basic parts:

TransactionProtocolHandler: Generates a session id for the current MI_Session and passes it to the HttpClient layer via MI_DestinationOptions.
SessionMap - a HashMap providing a mapping between a session id and an HTTP cookie.
HttpClient.c - adds/updates the SessionMap when a response is recieved with a MS-WSMAN cookie using the id created by TransactionProtocolHandler.  Ensures subsequent requests also include the session cookie.
NOTE: With office365, the session cookie changes virtually on every response and a single cookie cannot be used.
TransactionProtocolHandler removes the session id from the SessionMap when the session is destroyed. This is done via a call to a new  export HttpClient_RemoveSession.

NOTE: The current implementation initializes the HashMap on first use since there is no clear global initialization point.  Since there is also no clear global cleanup, the internal HashMap array is also leaked on shutdown.  Allocations for hashMap entries should not be leaked since MI_Session clean removes the associated entry.
Unlike the previous attempt, this approach is able to track the session cookie for all types of responses and solves the case where an error, such as an timeout, can cause the cookie to stale for the next request.","Fix #523

This fixes an issue when trying to establish a connection to an OMI server
from the WinRM Ruby library where NTLM/SPNEGO is enabled in the OMI server.","@dantraMSFT / @mwrock - I wanted to open this up and get a conversation started on the protocol handling here. I haven't fully read through all the relevant specs yet, but it's my understanding that the NTLMSSP_AUTH generated in response to a NTLMSSP_CHALLENGE can be multipart/encrypted over HTTPS as I've observed with the WinRM gem.
I have done a number of traces with WireShark to look at the sequence of messages from various clients (PowerShell 5 and 6 on Windows, PowerShell 6 on Linux, omicli on Linux, winrm gem) to various servers to get a better understanding of what's happening. The WinRM gem successfully connects to a Windows host using a multipart/encrypted response to the challenge (message construction code is at https://github.com/WinRb/WinRM/blob/master/lib/winrm/http/transport.rb#L111-L120). However, when trying to connect to OMI server, the OMI code completely skips the multipart/encrypted decoding as mentioned in this PR.
That said, two other clients respond to the server differently. The OMI client application on Linux sends an empty Body of application/soap+xml and the server returns 200. PowerShell 6.1 on Windows, when using the Enter-PSSession cmdlet, also sends application/soap+xml, with a non-empty Body that includes creation Xml to create a PowerShell instance (obviously these payloads are influenced by the action they're taking).
Given my understanding is SPNEGO can be sent over HTTPS during this part of the protocol lifecycle and given the standard PowerShell endpoint on Windows accepts a message of this Content-Type, I'm inclined to believe that OMI server should follow the same behavior. But, as I mentioned, I haven't really dug into the protocol spec enough to know for certain if OMI is following the protocol more strictly... and I haven't looked closely enough at this codebase to understand if the current processing is intentional for that or other reasons.
Once this change is made, at least OMI server decrypts the message, parses the SOAP message and tries to proceed. It actually ends up with another issue immediately after that based on the message that the gem sends. That message looks like this:

(FWIW, I did modify the WinRM gem code to send a different response. An emtpy message worked OK, but a KeepAlive message didn't).

handler is operating over SSL. In cases where the message was sent as
Content-Type: multipart/encrypted, the message response would be returned
as application/soap+xml if the transport was HTTPS. This could confuse
clients (such as the winrm gem) as they are expecting a response of
multipart/encrypted.
By all accounts, the PSRP implementation on Windows in PowerShell 5 and
PowerShell 6 allows multipart/encrypted spnego messages to be sent over
HTTPS.
Since the code already checks for handler->encryptedTransaction prior to
determining how to write response headers, it is safe to remove the SSL
check to allow mulitpart/encrypted over HTTPS. This change should
simply make the protocol handling more tolerant.


This fixes an issue when trying to establish a connection to an OMI server
from the WinRM Ruby library where NTLM/SPNEGO is enabled in the OMI server.

I was able to get a fully fleshed out PR (with tests that include real messages from OMI server) up against the winrm gem to fix the interop issues I encountered at WinRb/WinRM#288
I've traced the message flow in WireShark and with this patch, I see the expected responses being generated by the server - and the client is able to decrypt / process the messages correctly. I've additionally tested using Enter-PSSession from a Windows host with PowerShell 6.1.0 and found everything to behave correctly.  This is probably something that should have some tests, but I figured I would leave that up to the MS team.

Can you check how sshd listens on port 22 for both IPv4 and IPv6
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      63615/sshd

For some functionality to work we use ssh communication between MS and monitored device.

By default, enabledIPv6=false in omiserver.conf.
if(enableIPv6)
{
TryIPv6();

My only concern here is that when we only listen on IPv6 then for IPv4 communication the IPv4 address will be translated into IPv6 address. In most of the recent OS this translation layer is already present. But in older OS this translation layer might not be present. You need to check whether this translation layer is present on all the supported Linux and Unix distros and their versions.",True,{}

I somewhat disagree, macOS uses Heimdal so fixing one fixes the other.

Note: this PR does not include the action. If you're interested in running a spell check on every PR and push, that can be offered separately.
Disclaimer: GitHub does not like PRs w/ >250 commits (this has 465 at the time of filing). In general, reviewing windowed views is probably better than most alternatives (the standard git cli's diff output is fairly unhelpful for PRs like this).
Note: I fully expect to be asked to split this PR / reorganize it. If there are files that shouldn't be changed, let me know, dropping files is easy. If there are terms that can't be changed, that's also easy -- right now, a term is localized to a single commit, so dropping it means just dropping the commit.
It's possible for me to split by kind of content (comment vs code), but such things are moderately expensive and I try to do it as few times as possible and as late as possible.
I'll try to include annotations about the changes, but it'll take me a bit (it's a long PR)","This PR corrects misspellings identified by the check-spelling action.
