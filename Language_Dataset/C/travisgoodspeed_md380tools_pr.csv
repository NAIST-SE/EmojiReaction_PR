Only reason I went with underscores is because it was closest to the current system that was compatible with importing, I'm not attached to the scheme at all.

The reason I proposed this, is that this menu has, until now, not had any
other function than persisting the menu during rx. It has been quite
confusing for me to figure that out, until I read the German Readme.

More secure,"Howdy y'all,
It's not so much a matter of security as that we are only supporting hobbyists on mostly single user systems. Ham radio largely functions because folks agree not to be jerks to one another, and even though our repeaters could easily be jammed we rarely suffer more than the occasional troll.
If we ever support the radio on multi-user systems, such as a club server, then we'll include a section in the configuration guide for it.  For now, I'd rather not complicate the installation at the cost of more support requests.  666 permissions work well for software defined radios, and they should remain the default here.  The permissions can be reduced as needed on multi user machines.
Closing this issue.

First and foremost: the radio name is now set in the config from an automatic lookup in the usersdb whenever the DMR ID is changed. This means that peeps should be able to pass around codeplugs and never have to open them in a CPS.

'evolution' : see google group","Hello Travis,

Nice to hear from you for the first time. Unfortunately I only have an
RT3, and none of the fellows around has a GPS unit.
I noticed a small bug in the implementation (""zero"" in the config
structure, leaving the operator with an all-black screen that makes it
difficult to enter the MD380Tools menu at all).
Does it cause a much of work for you and the core devs if I ""request a
pull"" again with a slighly modified version ?

I considered this: If we had a of ""sizeof( addl_config )"" stored in the
first byte of struct addl_config itself,
any new application would have the chance to find a parameter was
already set the previously installed firmware
(because ""global_addl_config.my_size >= sizeof( addl_config )""),
and if not (size stored in the SPI flash smaller than the size in the
new firmware),
populate its own, new member (e.g. backlight_intensities) with a
meaningful default.

In this case, the set idle backlight to '1', and the active backlight to
'5', or similar.

Unfortunately this is incompatible as you noted to newbies (because the
byte at offset zero is already used for 'crc').
Or am I missing a point, and 'crc' in the first byte would automagically
detect a size mismatch, and fill the entire struct with zeroes ?

Greetings from Germany,
   Wolf DL4YHF .

ok. Someone asked me if the lowest intensity can be reduced even more,
and a few changes in SysTick_Handler() may do the trick.
The changes won't be ""dramatic"", I only expect to modify irq_handlers.c .
So all the rest (finding the patch addresses for SysTick_Handler in
S13.020) should not be affected by this.

Thanks for the amazing work & see you later,

 Howdy Wolfgang,

 Please take a few days to merge any last changes into
 Wolf-DL4YHF:DL4YHF-Backlight, then make a comment here telling me to
 begin porting it to S13.020 and merging.

 Cheers,

'evolution' : see google group","Hi Sven,

Can you try the compiled binary on my website ? The firmware needs a
patched interrupt vector table, which is achieved by a modified Python
script. I had included that script in my branch at Github, but didn't
check if the script is really invoked from the makefile.
The file 'experiment.bin' from
http://www.qsl.net/dl4yhf/RT3/dl4yhf_weak_backlight_experiment.zip
definitely contains all necessary patches (make sure you get a fresh
one; in this archive the timestamps are real).
Anyway, my temporary branch at github will be updated in a few days
after adding another, even darker backlight (a 'night owl mode'). In the
meantime I had modified so many things back and forth that the sources
need to be cleaned up before committing / pushing them again, to become
merged with Travis' ""official branch"" again (there's no need for a
permanent fork).

All the best,
   Wold DL4YHF .

'evolution' : see google group","Hi Sven and all,
I temporarily switched back to the earlier ""GPIO bitbanging PWM"". By the
time you read this it should be on the 'Wolf-DL4YHF' repo, and (compiled
into dl4yhf_weak_backlight_experiment.zip/experiment_PWM_via_GPIO.bin)
on my page at qsl.net .
The 'GPIO-variant' produces a PWM with only 74 Hz. The UART-variant uses
220 Hz (approximately).

I noticed that both variants suffer from the same problem in the menu
(""Backlt low"" + ""Backlt high"") :

The 'blue disc' that marks the currently selected item doesn't properly
follow the vertical scrolling position.
Only the blue marker bar marks the current setting (before navigating
with the cursor keys).
The same effect could sometimes be seen in other menus (iirc the date
format selection). Didn't look it up yet, maybe there's a topic already
existing for this in the google group.

Guess we should postpone any attempt to merge my temporary branch; I
need a better understand how the menu functions are supposed to work.

73,  Wolf .

'evolution' : see google group","Hi Sven and all 'dimmed backlight testers',

I have reduced the UART baudrate so the PWM frequency is 104 Hz now.
It's in my temporary branch on Github, but also (for convenience) in the
zip file at
   http://www.qsl.net/dl4yhf/RT3/dl4yhf_weak_backlight_experiment.zip

There are two variants of the backlight at the momemt, one producing the
PWM ""via GPIO"" and one ""via UART"".
The PWM frequency of the UART-variant is 104 Hz now, the GPIO variant
produces 74 Hz ( SysTick frequency, 666.6 Hz / 9 ).

If the UART variant still doesn't work on your radio please try the GPIO
variant, from the zip archive:
     experiment_PWM_via_GPIO.bin .

As before, both are ONLY for RT3 / MD380 (non-GPS). I added support for
the GPS devices, based on the S13.020 firmware, including the necessary
patches in the 'merge' scripts, but I cannot test them.

All these are contained in the Github repo now. In the repo, a switch is
already set to compile the interrupt handler (SysTick_Handler) for the
UART variant because (unlike the GPIO variant) it doesn't flicker at all.

Besides these pending tests, the temporary 'backlight' branch is ready
for being merged into the master.
I would prefer to have it merged back before beginning to play with the
microphone gain and audio signal paths.

Greetings from snow-covered Germany,
   Wolf .

Thanks, that's interesting. Something I would not have expected. So
maybe Tytera's part of the firmware reprograms the UART registers in
certain situations (here, it does not, which I checked by reading back
all USART6 registers via USB).

'evolution' : see google group","Hi Travis,

Yes I also think the existing hook (which btw was the only one i saw,
already existing) is possibly the wrong one.

Besides that, the rest of the patch for the dimmed backlight works
nicely, on two different radios (I tried it on one which never had a
patched firmware loaded before, and the default settings work properly now).

In the past days I dug deeply into the original firmware to find the
right hook (my bet is in the 'Start' - task) but there is one remaining
concern:
We possibly need to initialize ""our"" interrupt handlers twice (which is
ugly but seems unavoidable):

- first *before* Tytera's SystemInit() & Co, to have the backlight (and
other interrupt services) enabled during ""our"" early display ..
scrolling bitmap on the welcome screen, etc

- a second time *after* Tytera's ResetHandler(), SystemInit(), etc,
because those functions and anything called from there will possibly
'undo' any on-chip peripheral initialisation, via the RCC's ""peripheral
reset register"". Many Cortex startup functions I've seen over the years
leave ""nothing to fate"", and reset almost everything (via the RCC, which
is simply done by writing a couple of ONEs into those registers).

We will sooner or later experience similar when integrating Morse code
output in our own interrupt handlers.. it's of my next projects
(providing the morse output; retrieving the text of the currently
selected channel is another story - too difficult for me at the moment).

So here's my suggestion: Find out where to call our init function
(applet/src/irq_handlers.c : IRQ_Init), and merge any 'future'
interrupt-handler-initialisation into that module.

Cheers,
   Wolf .

That's fine about the fork. We can make one large merge.

function added. Probably after both of these PRs go through.

Neat project!  I did some cleanup and hopefully improved Python3 support as read through the code.  The big changes that I did were:

Updated Print calls
Removed semicolons at end of lines (not necessary in Python.  Your C is showing haha üòâ )
Comparison to None should be ""is"" or ""is not"" instead of ""=="" or ""!=""
No mixing Tabs and Spaces
Removed unused import statements
Whitespace
Augmented assigments were appropriate (i.e. i = i + 1 -> i += 1

No mixing Tabs and Spaces

The layout makes no difference to me, cause in my own fork I'm using another key layout since introducing netmon4, when we had this discussion first time.
But take a few minutes and let's have a look at the current keyboard & functions:
+-----+-----+-----+-----+

1 - SMS-Test
2 - Netmon5  (new 01/2017)
3 - Copy dst to contact (new 11/2016)

5 - clear syslog (new 10/2016)
6 - syslog dump
7 - Netmon off
8 - Netmon1
9 - Netmon2
'# - Netmon3
To be honest, my suggest for a clean UI and (fmpov) better handling (for right-handed users):
1 - SMS-Test
2 - remain spare
3 - Copy dst to contact (this is nice assigned with the arrow down key above as a hint symbol!)
4 - Netmon4

6 - syslog dump
0 - clear syslog *
7 - Netmon1 *
8 - Netmon2 *
9 - Netmon3 *
'# - Netmon off *
'* - reordered keys (7,8,9,# will only wrap around 1 position)
Only one key, ""clear syslog"" really moves it position from ""5"" to ""0"", Netmon5 is new, the bottom line only swaps its order.
The Zero-key ""Null"" will null/clear the syslog, other keys swapped remain in the same function blocks without unintentional causing a function or deleting something.
The right column will be used to clear or exit from a function (like the red special key above it), the left 3 columns activate or display something.",True,{}

there are two new LH screens (netmon5&6) that extend the functionallity of my former netmon4/LH-list.
Due to the fact, that I currently have no scrolling implemented, netmon5 gives you at the end of the LH log in line 9 the latest channel name additionally to logged call, on which the latest activity has been monitored and a page counter.
Netmon6 logs no callsigns but channel names on which activity has been monitored.
Both functions have been realized with slog (station log) & clog (=channel log) to be able to clear the logscreens independently (may be integrated in one multifunctional log in future revisions).
The features have been tested for a few weeks, on channels or during times like the weekly WW net on TG91 and in scanning mode these new features are very helpful, because netmon4 is currently limited to only 10 entries of last heard stations.

For the MD-380 and RT3 (always without GPS), the modification works (I
merged and tested it into my temporary branch with the *dimmed*
backlight now).

What the mod does not fix (at least not here) is the ""blue disc"" marker.
I still don't understand what controls it (blue disc in the circle...
doesn't scroll properly).

only did, what Travis asked me for in my last PR (#663) which I closed due to many other changes last night:

travisgoodspeed commented 6 days ago
To prepare for a merge, could you please update this branch with the following:
An accurate and complete description in the title and body of the pull request. (Not just comments.)
Resolve the merge conflicts in keyb.c, menu.c, and fixed.csv.
Add comments to slog.c, clog.c, and any other new functions or files.
Keyboard layout changes should probably be in separate pull requests from features, but we'll see what  can be done.

Large pull requests take a lot of effort to merge, because so many things have to be tested and verified first.  We can't just hit the ""merge"" button and hope for the best.
Some remaining issues:

 The keyboard layout changes really have to be in a separate pull request from functional changes.  Even if it's an improvement, folks will complain about the difference, and we need to do any UI changes exactly once to limit confusion.  This is the primary reason why this branch is slow to be merged.
 This branch has conflicts with menu.c and netmon.c.
 This branch breaks some of the talker-alias features in netmon.

This is, how software development is going on, when merging the changes will not have the speed of development ;-).
But I did wonder during the night from friday to saturday chatting with Rudy, when I submitted the first PR, that PD0ZRY's change within less the 30 minutes (that was the same time prepared in my PR, due to Rudy and I did test TA feature before together) was already merged by Simon, but maybe he didn't notice mine ...  ;-)
Otherwise I had only to submit the keyb.c again with the legacy layout ...
OK, I'll try to fetch some of my features again, but I'll not recode everything again for a 3rd time.

Please don't wonder about the draw_rx_screen twice in etsi, this is being hooked in my developer branch to draw_ta_screen but not working yet. For normal users it's directing to the standard draw routine in both cases. To be able to continue on this issue I currently need this as a placeholder.

Organized all backlight settings in a seperate submenu in md380tools menu instead of 3 main entries","Hi Simon, hi Travis,
yes I'll make smaller PR's in my next steps - but I also did try this in the past. The changes are so huge now, due to holding my PR during the last weeks. Netmon5 and 6 were already added in the middle of Januar, then I worked on the optimization of Sidebutton menu, after that adding TalkerAlias, correcting typos and moving options to Backlight submenu.
I made my changes in 8 different builds and after each step then every time I made a new PR, when I had tested this on my radios and updated my forked repo DL2MF/md380tools. I'll try to find out, how I can optimize this with branches in my own repo, like you suggested.
Due to many changes and many nights/hours of work I had with all these latest changes. I now have prepared a detailed changelog with additional comments of my code changes.
Many changes to TA effect addl_config.c, etsi.c, etsi.h, display.c, gfx.c, menu.c, netmon.c, netmon.h - I'm not able to put this into smaller steps and it will last several weeks again, if I had to make all my changes again, which will be almost impossible for me.
May you both please be so kind, to try to confirm my latest activities by this to get it merged?
mni tnx, vy 73
Mike, DL2MF
=====================================
Detailed changelog for PR #697:
Detailed explanation of sourcecode changes:
addl_config.c
=============
// talker alias added to submenu selection, before only userscsv eanbale/disable
-    R(global_addl_config.userscsv,1);
+    R(global_addl_config.userscsv,3);			// 2017-02-19	0-disable 1-userscsv 2-talkeralias 3-both

// fixed typo in string meny<->menu
-    md380_create_main_meny_entry();
+    md380_create_main_menu_entry();


display.c
=========
// etsi.h necessary for TA in display routines
+ #include ""etsi.h""

+ 224-273 were my additions of Rudy's PD0ZRY routines during parallel testing of TA while his build was not merged

+ 288-294 use new setup setting from addl_config.c when other display options than UserDB are selected

+ 309-384 modified version of draw_rx_screen under development for display of TA and embedded GPS (planned) instead of userscsv

- 305-111
+ 438-454 additional/optional display of TA or LH in date alt statusline 

// do redraw also for new TA in statusline
+ 486 if( is_statusline_visible() || global_addl_config.datef == 6 ) {

display.h
=========
// add draw_ta_screen
+void draw_ta_screen(unsigned int bg_color);


etsi.c
======
// dummy first try of calling TA redraw - commented out
         case 4 :
+		//if( global_addl_config.userscsv == 2 && talkerAlias.length != 0) {
+		//	draw_ta_screen(0xff8032);
+		//}

etsi.h
======
removing blank line


gfx.c
=====
// etsi.h necessary for TA in redraw routines
+ #include ""etsi.h""

// the time_hook is being used now from netmon4 (log=""l"") netmon5 (log=""s"") and netmon6 (log=""c"") to print timestamp in netmon logscreen
-void print_time_hook(void)
+void print_time_hook(char *log)

// use the right logroutine for output ot timestamp

lastheard.c
===========

// netmon5 and netmon6 are using, same like netmon4 (lastheard), seperate logtables SLOG + CLOG

-#define LASTHEARD_SIZE 1500 
+#define LASTHEARD_SIZE 1500
+#define SLOG_SIZE 1500
+#define CLOG_SIZE 1500
+
+#define LH_MAXLINES 20
+#define SMAXLINES 10
+#define CMAXLINES 10

21-43  define variables for the 3 different logtables, pagecounter, redraw flags

58-99  handle the logtable buffer wrapping

123-188 adaptions to lh_wrap, using new variable name fitting to the 2 other wrap buffers

190-420 new routines, very similar to the lastheard_log to handle printf, dump, clear of SLOG and CLOG


lastheard.h
===========
19-31, 37-66 necessary #define for SLOG and CLOG

Howdy Mike,
Thanks for the cleanup.  I've grabbed this branch and flashed it as both D13 and S13.  I'm able to send and receive calls, but the screen brightness feature seems broken, stuck at full brightness.
Looking closer, it seems the cause is that several hundred lines of irq_handlers.c have been cut in commit 71f0132, including backlight dimming and all of the incoming support for Morse code.  I'm sorry, but I really can't merge this branch.

thanks for working again on my branch, sorry for any inconvenience with this. It was my fault, after pulling a fresh clone on friday, I did copy older irq_handler.c/.h to my md380tools folder. Due to the changes to both files 4 days ago, these additions were lost.
Flashing my radio with the latest build, the screen brightness was working, also changing by the setup was successfully tested.
Hopefully I did now the final repair take both files from your official site back into my repo. Will wait for the CI build process to complete.

The netmon5 and netmon6 look nice, with some usefull information.

I've been using this radio excessive a week ago on a trip to FUNK.TAG Kassel operating many repeaters, simplex operation on the exhibition, scanmode the whole day/week from last Sunday to this Saturday, permanently powered ON and put to the dash charger during the night.

The pagecounter #232 yesterday afternoon = 2320 lines logged
There have been recorded > 2000 callsign entries in the Netmon4 - LH list, hundreds of channel entries in the new Netmon6 - Channel list. I've been using the radio on a business trip, in portable operation and at home - many hours RX/TX without any issues, no hang, no stuck, no reboot. To avoid any issues also 3 friends of mine are using a build on MD380 (DL3OBI), RT8 (DF7AH) and another MD390/G (DO5NF) without any trouble and are very lucky with the new features.

That's interesting .. 2000 callsign entries in Netmon4 is impressive,
but doesn't this eat up much of the precious tiny RAM that we have for
our own purposes ? For example, I am playing on an alternative menu,
with an alternative LCD driver (already working, much faster and less
QRM than the sluggish 'gfx'-stuff in the original firmware), but I think
our firmware additions must be very careful as much as memory (RAM)
usage is concerned.

Happy easter to you as well,
   Wolf DL4YHF.

 scanmode the whole week from Sunday to Saturday, permanently powered
 ON and put to the dash charger during the night.

I am just trying to understand some of the changes. What gives me
headaches is the modified ""print_time_hook()"". If this is really one of
the hooked functions (that are supposed to replace something, i.e. ""hook
into"" the original firmware), we must be extremely careful with the
function arguments. You modified it to take a ""char *log"" as function
argument, but compare ""log"" with a single character (not a char-pointer)
inside the function.
Very wrong (in print_time_hook) :
 if ( log == 'c' )
because you declared ""log"" as a char-pointer (I'd name it cpLog or even
pszLog (*) for that reason, but using data type prefixes is an almost
religious thing.. some like it, some hate it.)
(*) psz = pointer to a string with a zero-terminator, as a matter of taste

Besides that, the old problem with the non-functional netmon keys still
remains here, on an RT3 bought last december, which runs the
""D13.020""-based firmware without other problems. Do you have a readily
compiled+linked firmware image for comparison ? I have the impression
that this may be related with the build-tools used here (which I will
*not* change another time).

Cheers,
   Wolf .

The dot marker is missing in MD380Tools in all submenus with more than 4 entries, there is a bug in the submenu routines. Wolf, DL4YHF did already open an issue to this about 2 months ago, so nothing that is depending on latest changes.

K0BJR","Thanks Wolf,

I found that there's an oversight in the screen behavior: it doesn't exit
properly after entering in the new talkgroup.  This does not affect the TG
setting functionality, just requires that the user exit out manually or
wait for the screen to timeout.

But, I've already fixed it.  I'm a bit of a noob wrt github.  Shall I
submit a new pull request?

K0BJR","Hi Brad (and all)

you wrote:
 But, I've already fixed it. I'm a bit of a noob wrt github. Shall I
 submit a new pull request?

A difficult question, I cannot answer it completely (being a github noob
myself, only used version control dinosaurs so far). If the previous PR
isn't merged yet, it's no problem (I don't think Github ""takes a
snapshot"" of your branch in the second you pull the request. When it's
time to merge, the maintainer of the master (travisgoodspeed/md380tools)
will pull the modifications from *your* up-to-date repository.
Just make sure your own repo (on Github) is sync'd with the files on
your harddisk.

The question is often when to pull a 'brand-new' request, because it
causes a lot of work to the maintainers.
The less time it took between creation of your own (""temporary"") branch,
committing it to your own repo, and pulling a merge-request for it, the
less work it will be for the maintainers to merge it because there are
only a few modifications (ideally).
But if other 'merging activities' are currently taking place, your
(pending) branch is getting older, and more difficult to merge unless
you keep it synced with Travis' master. (This can be done in the 'Github
desktop' thingy; I guess if 'Update from travisgoodspeed/master' is
grayed out,  there's ""nothing to do"").

So for my part, I keep developing further even if an own PR may still be
pending. And even if it's still pending, I commit changes to *my*
repository so others can see what I'm currently working on, and (if
anyone really cares and spend the time) can try out the modifications
*before* there's a pull-request for them.

Anyway, Murphy's law ensures that errors are discovered shortly *after*
committing / pulling requests / having them merged. Been there,
regretted it, what else can you do ? ;o)

At the moment there are two PRs pending, one of them for some time
already. I just withdrew mine (which btw was for issue #704, reduce the
number of compiler warnings)  to avoiding possible merge conflicts. When
the pending ones are merged, I simply sync my temporary branch from
Travis' master again, and (eventually) pull a new PR.


Short form: IMHO, just let your PR pend (since you don't want your
addition to 'vanish') . If there are significant changes on Travis's
master, merge them into your own branch to check for conflicts yourself.
Keep committing to our branch (in ""small documented steps"") regardless
of a PR pending or not.

   Wolf .",True,{}

Implementation:
Two new functions in menu.c:

void create_menu_entry_set_tg_screen(void)
These functions add a new menu item to set the talkgroup of the current channel using numeric entry.  The code is mostly copied from the edit_dmr_id functions, but the entry is placed into the appropriate nibbles of the extern contact structure.  Writing to the appropriate tg address is accomplished using a copy of the code from the copy_dst_to_contact() function in keyb.c.
The current talkgroup is loaded into the edit buffer.  A change must be confirmed then the new talkgroup is loaded for use.

I'd like to get your thoughts on menu hooks and the menu drawing
internals.  I've been working to expose the set_tg_id functionality in the
set sidebutton menu using an appropriate case in keyb.c. Here's what I've
learned (these things are likely very obvious to you and other developers).
‚Ä¶
-The menu structure gets built every time the ""Menu"" button is pressed.
Prior to the first press, it does not exist.  Therefore any calls to draw a
submenu directly must build the structure first.  I can built the
addl_functions menus but can't find a hook or calling sequence to build the
full menu structure.
-Simply setting gui_opmode1 to  SCR_MODE_MENU and calling the function
specified in the submenu creation is not enough, there are other screen
rendering operations that are executed as part of the normal menu traversal
that are skipped when I do this.  The result is that some of the menu
elements are drawn, but others are not.  It is not usable.
-There probably a very hackish way to use some stateful logic the the rtc
code to simulate the button presses and get to the menu, but it seems like
an awful route.

Any info you can offer is greatly appreciated.

K0BJR","Hello Brad and all,

By chance, I am also trying to understand more details about the menu
internals (btw to report the currently focused, or currently selected
menu item in Morse code). For the button lists it works, but not for
Tytera's main menu, and several submenus opened from there.
Some time ago I accidentally found the C sources of what *may* be an
older version of the GUI that has been used in the Tytera software. It's
a grandfather of EmWin (and the stuff that ST offer for their CPUs, very
unfortunately only as a compiled library). But this one includes the
full C sources which may helpful for understanding the details:
https://github.com/fazibear/Misa-Kitara-AP

The huge zip contains embedded operating system for a futuristic (kind
of) electronic guitar, including a GUI based on Segger's/Micrium's
uC/GUI, which years later evolved into ST's ""STEmWin"" (or whatever the
name is now). I didn't study the sources of this old uC/GUI  (Version
3.98) yet. On a short glance, it contains a lot of low-level and high
level graphic stuff, including fonts, menus, radio-button widgets, etc.
Because it's over 6 years old, there may be large differences between
this and the MD380 firmware.

If you're interested, start grokking at GUI/Core/GUI.h .
For example, GUI_CONTEXT has some similarities with ""our"" gfx_...
structures.
With some luck, we may be able to spot similarities also in the 'Widget'
directory (especially ""MENU.c"", ""SCROLLBAR.c"", ""RADIO.c"", ""CHECKBOX.c"",
""EDIT_xyz.c"" ).

Maybe time to look into this again ? Trying to understand the
disassembled code is extremely time-consuming (at least for me, despite
being familiar with C and ARM), and whenever I look at it, I am deeply
impressed by the work that Travis and others have already invested to
find out how this 'blackbox' works.

Have a nice weekend,
   Wolf .

I trust that everyone is having a nice weekend.  I verified that this pull request, #708 , merges fine with the latest talker alias mods merged from #697 .  I'm happy to address any concerns that are pending prior to merging.
I'm still occasionally working on allowing extended menu items to be called from the sidebuttons.  It's a thorny issue.  If anyone has information on the call sequence for the built-in sidebutton menu items, I'd like to learn about them.  @Wolf-DL4YHF: I'm working on learning the disassembly that you pointed me toward.

These functions add a new menu item to set the talkgroup of the current channel using numeric entry.  The code is mostly copied from the edit_dmr_id functions, but the entry is placed into the appropriate nibbles of the extern contact structure.  Writing to the appropriate tg address is accomplished using a copy of the code from the copy_dst_to_contact() function in keyb.c.
The current talkgroup is loaded into the edit buffer.  A change must be confirmed then the new talkgroup is loaded for use.
I am happy to accept any comments regarding the form or function of this code.
Thanks for the opportunity to contribute to this project.

K0BJR","Hello Brad,

Maybe your TG extension is a good candidate for the new 'app menu',
which is completely under our control because it uses none of the
original firmware's menu- and graphics functions.
In other words, we can invoke that menu anytime we want, and inside it,
can do anything we want (navigate through lists, show menu items and
their current values, edit them 'in line', or draw complete custom
screens). It is opened from the main screen with the red ""back"" button
(which has no function on the original main screen). The ""Set TG""
feature would be one of the first items in the new menu opened that way.
It still lacks support for drawing bitmaps in Tytera's format, but imho
it's better suited (and faster) than fiddling around with Tytera's
origninal menu.
Since (at the moment) I am the only one familiar with this ""new"" menu
system, let me first finish the method for direct alphanumeric input
(when a menu item is in ""edit"" mode). The Set TG feature will be easy to
use, and faster to invoke than when buried deeply in the original menu.

I will pull a merge request for it soon, even though I am still working
on the new modules (app_menu.c for the menu framework, lcd_driver.c for
the own, much faster LCD driver). At the moment, this is only in my own
fork (dl4yhf/md380tools) on Github.

Cheers,
   Wolf .

 Hello All,

 I trust that everyone is having a nice weekend. I verified that this
 pull request, #708
 <#708> , merges fine
 with the latest talker alias mods merged from #697
 <#697> . I'm happy
 to address any concerns that are pending prior to merging.

 I'm still occasionally working on allowing extended menu items to be
 called from the sidebuttons. It's a thorny issue. If anyone has
 information on the call sequence for the built-in sidebutton menu
 items, I'd like to learn about them. @Wolf-DL4YHF
 <https://github.com/Wolf-DL4YHF>: I'm working on learning the
 disassembly that you pointed me toward.

 Thanks,

 Brad

I have adapted your method for the new 'app menu' now. Seems to work well, even when invoked via programmed sidekey (which would have been a nightmare to implement with the original 'Tytera' menu).
The only problem that remains (at the moment) is how to convince Tytera's main display screen to show the modified tx-talkgroup above the off-hook phone icon. But that's more or less a cosmetic issue.

 <#732> is correct,
 then both gfx.c and gfx.h will need to change in this PR.

I don't think merging this PR will delay anything. Except for the
""const"" specified (which I will add in my own branch now to avoid future
trouble), the prototype / declaration of print_time_hook would be the
same as PR #726 .

What I am still  (a bit) concerned about is this:
Since ""print_time_hook"" looks like one of the special functions designed
to replace something in the original firmware,
will THE ORIGINAL FIRMWARE call it from somewhere ? If it did, it would
hardly pass in a 'char' as a function argument in register R0, and the
content of R0 (= char log) would be unpredictable then.
In other words: If print_time_hook replaces a function of the original
firmware, we should not change the function's argument list at all.
Well, I didn't have the time to look it up in the symbol file or in the
disassembled original firmware yet, to examine the call stack for
print_time_hook() .


Cheers,
   Wolf .

Thanks, and I promise to be careful. I have forked the main repository
to remove some of my own (internal) commits and their descriptions,
which nobody will read anyway. In the meantime there's not only the
Morse output, but also an alternative menu (with its own, independent
LCD driver) which makes adding new features and easier. But more on that
later.

Cheers,

 Sorry for Github's complications, neighbor. I'll give you commit
 rights tonight in the hope that will make things smoother.

Thanks for the info. Basically this is what I had been using in earlier
development steps, but this time, I got flooded with merge conflicts
which (to me) didn't make sense at all. Well, most of them have been
fixed in the meantime.

Looks there were just too many subsequent changes, all of them
documented very frequently by myself (for each and every module written
in the meantime, related with the Morse output and the new, alternative
'text mode' menu).

I simply cloned the main repository again, and synchronized the files
with my local repository (DL4YHF branch) with the 'fresh' main
repository. This also reduced the size of the zipped repository from
almost 80 MByte to about 54 MByte. The revision history of my own
changes got lost this way (but of course not the revision history of
other contributors). So far, no more merge conflicts, and even the
'Travis CI' build processed finished flawlessly with both build
environments. Sigh..

Anyway, I deleted the old PR (#734 with many dozens of small
modifications) and replaced it by PR #741 which should be easier to
merge. There's a minor thing left to do (related with the codeplug
structure used inside the SPI flash, which I cannot validate for GPS
devices / S13.020), but that's another topic.

All the best,
   Wolf .

The problem is two-fold:

The code does not actually work for the stated purpose (as the comment in the commit indicates).
The conditional guarding the code allows it to execute outside of the condition it was crafted for (aka: it triggers regardless of the idle/rx state of the radio).

Thanks for the feedback.  I went with a simple ""--retry 3"" because of my impression that archive.org is typically pretty responsive, but occasionally will send back an empty file.

When the download completes, it exits before the max time value.    I can clearly see it linger up to 15 seconds when testing on a 3G wifi hotspot, and my users in Europe are seeing it grow to over 30 seconds now.    I actually have my VM running at 180 right now!  Execessive?  Maybe, but the script is a total fail if the download doesn't come in so might as well give it a few more seconds to try and finish.

I thought about adding a circular wrap for the menu item index myself, and was a bit concerned about this:
For a blind operator, it was easy to scroll to the end or the top of the list by simply holding the cursor down/up key pressed for some time, and let the autorepeat do the rest.

This build has been tested very in-depth and you might have noticed, that PollKeysForScroll() is being called every 111th SysTick, what is far enough for cursor scrolling.

This firmware is running since a week on my two MD-390/G and a MD-446, both types very extensively in use and currently all radios are working fine, also when in use for > 10h a day.
My latest pull request now also includes the user-selectable keyb layout for MD-3x0/MD-446 inside the option menu, no need any more to compile separately firmware for the MD-446. This might also be a lookahead for upcoming new models supported by MD380tools.",True,{}

I also need a weird hack to set the USB config (looks like a problem in the FreeBSD USB stack).  If you're documenting it somewhere, I added the following to /etc/devd.conf:
# Tytera MD-390 and related radios
notify 200 {
        match ""system""          ""USB"";
        match ""subsystem""       ""DEVICE"";

        action ""/usr/sbin/chown root:wheel /dev/$cdev && /bin/chmod 0660 /dev/$cdev && usbconfig -d $cdev set_config 0"";
};

That will get the tools working, but actually building the firmware is a bit trickier involving building a working cross-toolchain.

Radio is connected to computer.
Turn on radio, start dmesgtail.

FYI. There are a couple of guys in Italy porting the OpenGD77 to the MD-380, but the radios which uses the AT1846S RF chip (and the C6000) are an easier target, and I suspect the MD-9600 is one of these, because TYT seem to use the AT1846S their dual band radios.
The MD UV-380 definitely uses the AT1846S, but I don't know if the bootloader is the same on this radio, which would allow the encryption to be broken.",True,{}

Unfortunately, Travis' trick to dump the bootloader does not work on anything I have tried except md380, so I had to find a new way to get the encryption keys. The mduv380/390/rt3s use the same encryption key as md2017. Interesting enough, if you change the radio identifier using the factory util to make it match a 2017 for example, it will run fw meant for a 2017 (with bugs ofc, but still interesting).
EDIT: Took some pics of my md9600 when I took it apart to play around.  https://photos.app.goo.gl/2t7yWTA1R9bZEF8Z9
Also I took a look at the CS580 which has a similar mcu to the gd-77 I think, and it does not seem to even use encryption or try to prevent any modifications o_O.
One more thing, on the website for the CS800 support they have a bldr available for flashing for use with the factory usb bldr that stm32f4 family uses.  You can modify this and go down the chain to allow for modifications on that radio as well.",True,{}

Thanks.
If the encryption key / hash table is known, then I presume you can encode your own application code and get the bootloader to accept.
So to dump the bootloader just requires an application to be written which enumerates on USB as a COM port, and it could then just dump the bootloader as hex bytes into a terminal program.
This would not be super efficient, but would probably be the easiest way to get the bootloader binary
Once the binary has been downloaded, it can be patched using Ghidra to remove any nasty code that disables the SWD and read protects the MCU, and then the new booloader can be flashed on via SWD.
I'm not sure how advanced they are with their code, but the Italian guys porting the OpenGD77 to the MD-380 may have a version which has functional USB COM (CDCACM)",True,{}

It was just a suggestion, as it does yield about 30% extra compression on the entire uncompressed string for each record.
However, it would yield less compression on your shorter sub strings.
BTW. I initially thought your compression, also handed all the complete duplicate records, where people have 2 or 3 ID's and completely the same information in each, apart from the ID
I wonder if you could somehow add that as some sort of special case.
But you'd need to see how much compression that yielded.
There are also a large number of ID's which hardly ever get used.  HamDigital.org used to maintain a list of active ID's which could be downloaded with activity range limits up to 1 year or more.
And I recall, only about 50% of the IDs were every active in any given year.
Of course of DMR MARC supported TA, then none of this would be necessary ;-)
And I don't know why no one has written an extension to MMDVMHost to inject TA, because that would fix the problem for the large number of people using hotspots etc on DMR MARC, and potentially for all DMR MARC repeaters which use MMDVMHost
Unfortunetly I don't have time to update MMDVMHost, because I'm busy on loads of other projects",True,{}
