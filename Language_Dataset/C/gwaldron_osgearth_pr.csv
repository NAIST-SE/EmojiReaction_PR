Imagine being tethered to an aircraft model, following its yaw, pitch, and roll, zoomed forward so you're sitting on the nose.
But by setting a negative focus distance, it messes up the terrain avoidance minimum distance, which uses the same variable.  We've seen lots of funky behavior with terrain avoidance doing something ""close to right"" but not quite right.  I finally tracked it down to the reuse of this variable.  The only documentation that I could find that this variable was used was from Glenn on our internal help desk, who mentioned this on the same issue that this change resolves (SIM-4453).
In short, this lets us independently vary the minimum ""zoom"" value and keep it distinct from the ""minimum distance from terrain"" variable.  Though they're both minimums, they represent two different values both conceptually, and (in this patch) in the code as well.",True,{}

Right, osgdb_osgearth_engine_mp.dll is not accessible at all.  This can happen if the end user developing an app messed up on their paths, or during configuration, or during a bad deployment.  We develop an SDK that uses osgEarth as a baseline and we get a surprising number of issues from end user developers that boil down to bad paths and not being able to load OSG plug-ins because of this.

What would osgEarth do if it can't find the terrain engine at all?

The only thing I would expect (perhaps ""hope for"") is that it not crash.  Beyond that, I'd expect that it couldn't do anything useful.  Most of the code already looks quite well protected against this, there were only a small handful of places I was able to spot in a ""normal"" run where pointer validity wasn't checked.
In our SDK we try to detect this condition and print debugging info to the end user (e.g. osgDB::Registry::getLibraryFilePathList() search path and the MP DLL name).  When the user has a misconfigured path, what we're seeing is an error from osgEarth about MP, then a crash (due to unprotected NULL accesses).  This PR simply prevents the NULL crashes in the cases I spotted.",True,{}

see bug #800","Thanks for the PR. At this time we don't think this the right solution. Generally speaking (in GIS tools e.g.) a Group Layer connotes the ability to operate on the layer as a Group in all capacities (toggling visibility, changing render order, and so on), while your approach is only a deserialization semantic. It also doesn't persist in the Map model, so the group will not be present if you re-serialize the same MapNode.
We have contemplated the idea of Group layers quite a few times over the years but have not implemented them because the concept does carry these expectations.",True,{}

So here are the changes to get gles3 working. Mostly changes to the shader merging, ensuring version number define is used everywhere and some work on static builds.
It also now generates the iOS example from CMake so should be a lot more user friendly.
I'm having issues now with tiles not paging in properly. It was working before but something seems to have crept in and I keep having issues with trianglefunctor type code crashing the app since osg added that new triange code. I just want to get this merged though as none of this has anything to do with that I it's getting a bit difficult to keep it up to date with the osgearth master.

So here are the changes to get gles3 working. Mostly changes to the shader merging, ensuring version number define is used everywhere and some work on static builds.
It also now generates the iOS example from CMake so should be a lot more user friendly.
I'm having issues now with tiles not paging in properly. It was working before but something seems to have crept in and I keep having issues with trianglefunctor type code crashing the app since osg added that new triange code. I just want to get this merged though as none of this has anything to do with that I it's getting a bit difficult to keep it up to date with the osgearth master.
Thanks

For example, when the MapNode changes in this case, the observer_ptr becomes invalidated, but the update traversal has already been turned off so you'll not catch new MapNodes.  You could keep update traversal on, but there's a performance cost to that and it results in unnecessary polling, since 99.99% of the time on update you won't have a map change.
Maybe it's messy, but it's also more cost efficient than the update traversal approach.
It would also more deeply complicate what we're currently during with the node layout in simVis::SceneManager.  I do not offhand know the ramifications of making everything a child of the map again.  I do know that we'd need to be more careful about displacing the old MapNode with the new MapNode, replacing children as needed.  Shouldn't be a big deal, but I just don't know offhand whether we'll have any graphics ramifications of this.

I didn't merge it as is, but I used it for inspiration in my commit cc17e47 that adds support for GDAL 2.0's new support for specifying a resampling algorithm during RasterIO operations.  Having an internal rasterio is a great place to isolate differences between the 1.x and 2.x branches of gdal, thanks for the idea!  I think my commit also addresses your unused return value warning, if you can check on your end and see that would be awesome.  Thanks again!",True,{'THUMBS_UP': ['https://github.com/remoe']}

what that define does

It fixes linking with shared GEOS libraries.

Ok, let's check it.

Usage of -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-DGEOS_INLINE=1' (as you see in mxe/mxe@a118ee0) is not a solution of problem, but just another way to workaround it. We will use it if necessary. But providing patches for upstream is more preferable way.",True,{}

I believe you that this fixes the issue, but I want to understand why to see if we can do a more general fix.  The default attribute location for the ObjectIndex is SECONDARY_COLORS (which is attribute location 4).  Changing it to 8 is changing it to TEXTURE_COORDS_0, which doesn't seem like what you would want to do.  I believe the enum locations are setup to map to nvidia's driver attribute locations, but I'm sure that is different on OSX.
Do you have a feel for what the core issue is here?  Is using attribute location 4 (SECONDARY_COLORS) stomping on the something in the osx driver that isn't an issue on windows?  What about using attribute 5 (FOG_COORDS), would that work instead?",True,{}

However this is now protected against change from an ifndef on OSG_GL_FIXED_FUNCTION_AVAILABLE.  This is because out of the box, Triton 3.91 will fail with anything but OPENGL_2_0 due to an error in VAO handling.
The WATER_DECALS issue was a problem both in 3.91 and 4.01 in core profile.  It is not a problem in compatibility profile for 3.91, but based on my reading of the code there is typically not a shader installed here anyways.
The mode validity prevents OSG from setting GL_LIGHTING on the next state change.  This should only be needed in Core profile mode, as the flag is deprecated in 3.2
After this series of changes, I now have Triton drawing an ocean in examples in Linux g++ 4.4 and Windows MSVC 2015 x64 against 3.91.  I tested Linux in 4.01 but decided against upgrading for now, so I didn't get around to testing Windows on that side.",True,{}

In this specific case, I did not run the INSTALL target from OSG.  The master project using these libraries did not require an “install”, so adding this include means I did not have to do anything other than “just build”.  (Which simplified CI/CD.)

The cause was two threads grabbing data from the PerObjectFastMap in the same HorizonClipPlane.  This was a problem because when the second thread grabbed an entry, it caused the std::vector in fast_map to increment.  That invalidated iterators and references due to a resize in std::vector.  That caused the 'd' reference to become invalid in the first thread, leading to a crash once the first thread got control again.
This was mitigated by replacing the vector with a std::list, which will not invalidate the iterator / data values on insertion.  The primary downsides to this simple fix are that size() is now potentially O(n) (primarily on gcc on older c++ standards), and iteration is possibly slightly slower.",True,{}

Because Version.h was not included (from Triton), the define was never set, so new Triton (4+) is pulling out variables from the wrong program.  This means Triton 4+ never carries over Uniforms; this is now fixed by including Version.h.
The other problem is that Triton shaders might depend on uniforms like osg_ProjectionMatrix in order to detect things like ortho display in shader.  While NativeProgramAdapter correctly found the uniform ID mapping for osg_ProjectionMatrix, it never actually made it to Triton because State::applyModelViewAndProjectionUinformsIfRequired() is the code that actually applies those uniforms to the State, and it isn't run here.  Calling it directly is not appropriate because the _lastAppliedProgramObject is not set.  This change just hits all of the built-ins explicitly.

Its minor, but important","It's certainly possible that there was some sort of build or installer
glitch at that time that we never knew about. If so I apologize for the
oversight.

However, I can confirm that Version.h is being generated reliably now. The
solution of just copying over the Version.h from the Linux distribution
seems fine to me. But, a conditional compile of the API changes that
depends not only on the value of our version #define's but also their
existence would do the job too. If they don't exist at all, it's safe to
say you're using a SilverLining version from before the API changes.

Thank you,

 I'm curious as to how did the geos update sneak in (which breaks osgearth)
 without triggering a pipeline build failure in osgearth.
 Shouldnt this have been caught by the pipeline build in the Pull-Request
 for the geos 3.8.1 update ?

In AnnotationNode's case, there's no benefit that I can see to having it be an Observer, because the set-to-NULL operation in the callback is already happening anyways, and nothing ""extra"" happens.
In the case of GeoTransform, extra stuff is happening on delete.  There are two problems with the objectDeleted implementation here though:

There's a comparison against the observer_ptr in the first line.  But that observer_ptr might (or might not) have gotten its objectDeleted call, and may already be NULL.  So it's not a great idea to do the comparison here because it might erroneously fail due to order of operations in OSG C++ code.  To fix, we don't compare, since it's only called when the object being observed is deleted and we can only ever observe the item that is _terrain.  So the check is superfluous.  I added checks to setTerrain() to make sure the checks in objectDeleted are superfluous.
Setting the observer_ptr to NULL will cause it to remove itself from a list of Observers that is currently being iterated.  This leads to iterator invalidation.  Instead, don't touch _terrain and let observer_ptr do its job, preventing iterator invalidation, which led to crashes.",True,{}

We are building osgEarth on MSVC 2019, which has a newer Windows SDK by default than some of the older MSVC versions.  As such, the Win10 preprocessor define is defined.  I can, on a Windows 7 (I know) machine build the software, but then can't run it on the same machine.
Adding this check by itself does not cause the code to work, because if undefined, _WIN32_WINNT will default to _WIN32_WINNT_WIN10.  But this gives us an opportunity to set the target _WIN32_WINNT in our CMake configuration, allowing us to target older versions than Windows 10.
Without this change (and a define in CMake command line / CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS), osgEarth builds on MSVC 2019 in such a way that it will only run on Windows 10 systems.  With this change, that's still the same default, but you can specify CXX flags to override that behavior.",True,{}

These were all users with older cards (e.g. Matrox C420 with 22.19.693.256 driver, AMD Radeon HD 7730M) that were experiencing this issue. Drivers were as upgraded as they could get (newer drivers don't support older card).
The symptom manifested essentially as a blank, black globe. With the simple sky model enabled, we could see the lighting along the edge of the globe, but no texture data. We could add things like line features onto the globe and they were drawn correctly, it was just the underlying globe imagery data that wasn't rendering. This used to work on software releases 9+ months back.
We were able to generate API Trace output from a failing laptop. When running the replay through API Trace, the display was incorrect when run on the AMD Radeon HD 7730M. But when we ran the exact same trace file through API Trace on systems with other cards, everything was looking fine.
Current belief is that there's something funky with the VAO state and EBO that isn't being captured by these older cards, forcing a requirement to generate and rebind it each time.",True,{'THUMBS_UP': ['https://github.com/remoe']}

For our time-based application, this simply meant looping time around to before the entity creation. The label was still valid, just not visible. At this time, the priority and declutter flags update (verified with cout). And simultaneously, the label is turned back on.

Float conversion issues are causing artifacts near edges, preventing some pixel-testing from working, which we use for transparent image guessing.","I think it's only an issue on writing because the ColorReaders cast the results of the pointer increments to float before performing an operation, whereas the ColorWriters don't.
As an example, the image we're sending through this code via osgEarth::ImageUtils::convertToRGBA8() is white .bmp image with a small blue arrow in the middle. We convert it to RGBA format, then run a transparent color guess algorithm on the image (adapted from FOX code) to determine what color we should be replacing with transparent.
Before the change in the commit referenced above, ColorWriter for GL_RGBA correctly converted the pixels to 255. After the change, the RGBA values are 254.
The image resulting from osgEarth::ImageUtils::convertToRGBA8() returns true from osg::Image::isImageTranslucent(), when it didn't before, which we use as an early-out on our own code when guessing a color to replace with transparent. Hope this all makes sense.",True,{}
