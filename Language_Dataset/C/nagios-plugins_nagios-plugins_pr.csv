Sorry for the late response, but we're gearing up to do a release soon.

I agree with you that your current default is correct in this case. For a minor release, I feel backwards compatibility trumps ideas about how plugins ""should"" work.
I think Bryan meant that you should include a packages_critical variable to compare against as well. To me, it looks like the plugin reserves the CRITICAL state for security-related packages. I'm fine leaving this as-is for 2.3.0.
The ~:10 is referring to the nagios-plugins threshold format. Arguably, making the threshold configurable means that it should follow that format, but I would be surprised if anyone needed this (and, of course, it can always be added later in the event that someone does).

Yes, I implemented all these fixes because some performance data were missing in our setup (which is Icinga 2 + Graphite + Grafana), and there were messages in logs complaining about the units.

#139
The above commit modified the /bin/ping command line to use the -W parameter instead of -w for specifying the timeout. -w is a global timeout for the command whereas -W specifies the maximum time to wait for a single ping response. This caused a number of issues:


For unresponsive hosts instead of the ping command timing out and providing useful output, viz:
PING CRITICAL - Packet loss = 100%|rta=1200.000000ms;600.000000
we get instead:
CRITICAL - Plugin timed out
This is because the -W param is effectively a timeout for the last ping packet sent, so the ping command is executing for a max ""timeout + num packets"" seconds instead of ""timeout"" seconds. Thus the SIGALRM set to ""timeout + 1"" seconds is triggering and killing the plugin.


The above behaviour is inconsistent with other ping commands specified in configure.ac for other OS's such as BSD Unix. Eg: -X for /bin/ping6 or -t for  /bin/ping, which both specify a global timeout like -w on GNU/Linux.


To properly address Issue #139 I believe we'll need to add an additional parameter to check_ping to specify the maximum wait time for a single ping packet.","Revert commit b7ee01a (Fix for issue #139) which incorrectly modifies timeout behaviour of the check_ping plugin.

PING CRITICAL - Packet loss = 100%|rta=1200.000000ms;600.000000
we get instead:
CRITICAL - Plugin timed out
This is because the -W param is effectively a timeout for the last ping packet sent, so the ping command is executing for a max ""timeout + num packets"" seconds instead of ""timeout"" seconds. Thus the SIGALRM set to ""timeout + 1"" seconds is triggering and killing the plugin.


The above behaviour is inconsistent with other ping commands specified in configure.ac for other OS's such as BSD Unix. Eg: -X for /bin/ping6 or -t for  /bin/ping, which both specify a global timeout like -w on GNU/Linux.


To properly address Issue #139 I believe we'll need to add an additional parameter to check_ping to specify the maximum wait time for a single ping packet.",You bring up some good points here. I'll need to think on this for a bit.,True,{}

Sure, curious to hear what you come up with. I'm not sure the original problem specified in #139 still exists (i think it was exclusive to the old check_icmp?), but I can confirm that /bin/ping -w 30 still sends 30 packets to an unresponsive host if the timeout is set to 30s. I don't think this is a problem though, it's how ping works internally by retrying failed packets, and it seems to correctly account for the extra packets when calculating the packet loss %.
*EDIT:
Thinking again, another option is to convert the timeouts for the other OSs to use the equivalent of -W, and then set the value passed to -W = MAX(1, timeout - num_packets). This would ensure only num_packets are sent in all cases if that is desired.",True,{}

It looks like the ""problem"" reported in #139 (ICMP packets sent exceeds -p argument) was not the user's actual complaint (packet loss showed <100% even though host was completely dead).
The user also claimed that they were having the same issue with both check_icmp and check_ping, and then that changing all checks to use check_ping fixed the issue. Given that I haven't reproduced the original problem yet, I suspect there was some other anomaly on their network - a dead host being brought up for a minute before crashing again, or something like that.
Anyways, #504 is clever, but simply reverting the change seems like the safer option.",True,{}

I agree that the change will work in most cases. However, I don't know where this plugin is being used. I'm somewhat concerned about using a hardcoded path for the tmp file.
Here are some possible alternatives:

Accept the tmp file path from the user, and don't use a tmp file unless such a path is provided.
Check for $TMPDIR first, and only use /tmp as a fallback

Thank you 👍","Thank you for your interest in this @chicks-net.
Goal adding a perfdata separator is to be able to easily separate the instance name (127.0.0.1 in example above) from the metric name itself (rta, pl...), in an automatic manner (split would then occur at # character in example above).
So that we can properly feed time-series databases, with well-defined metric name, and instance name pushed for example as a metric tag (in InfluxDB for example).
Hope @sawolf will be willing to merge this anytime soon 👍",True,{}

I agree that this is pretty niche, but I'm okay with adding it if it's useful to some people.

People expect negate to transparantly and consistently map a check's result X to result Y depending only on its exit code, and not on its stderr output - which is not relevant for nagios either.

But by design, when a non-root process calls access(2) or similar permission checks, the kernel answers using an empty set of capabilities. Quoting the access(2) man page verbatim:

This allows set-user-ID programs and capability-endowed programs to easily determine the invoking user’s authority. In other words, access() does not answer the “can I read/write/execute this file?” question. It answers a slightly different question: “(assuming I’m a setuid binary) can the user who invoked me read/write/execute this file?”, which gives set-user-ID programs the possibility to prevent malicious users from causing them to read files which users shouldn’t be able to read.

What this means is that under Linux, perhaps non-intuitively, you must not rely on access(2) or stat(2) (or any higher-level test that ultimately uses these system calls) to determine whether the current process can read a file. E.g.: access(2) may return -1 when in fact opening the file in question would succeed because the process holds the CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH capability.
Therefore, instead of using [ -r FILE ] to check whether the log file is readable, use dd to read 0 bytes from the log file.

I can see a good use for this and it doesn't break backward compatibility, so I'm quite happy about that.
There was one thing I changed - in the two calls to xasprintf(), the extra %s's weren't separated by whitespace. That might work for the format you put here, but if someone had their page write out something like key1=1 key2=2 key3... instead, there might be issues.
Not a big deal either way - just a heads up that you'll want to confirm the plugin is still working as you expect after I merge. The patch should be pulled in shortly. Also, I've credited you as Tobias Leich in the changelog/contributors files. If you prefer to use a different name, send me an e-mail - I'm not likely to catch Github notifications at the moment.",True,{}

I agree with you that #618 could be obnoxious in some circumstances. However, it looks like the changes on lines 119-121 will clobber the following output line, which may be useful for troubleshooting. I'll fix this on my end, just letting you know so you aren't surprised when you update to the official project and the behavior is slightly different.
Otherwise, it looks good to me. The patch should be merged shortly. I've credited you as Guillaume Rousse in the changelog/contributors file. If you would prefer to use a different name, send me an e-mail - I'm unlikely to catch any Github notifications in the short term.",True,{}

I don't know very much about software packaging, so my apologies if these questions are naive:

First, is it standard to include packaging instructions inside the main repository of a project? For all of our projects that I'm aware of, we've let distro maintainers and packagers figure out how they want to build and manage the software for their distro, and tried not to dictate anything from upstream.
Second, in debian/control, it looks like nagios-plugins is set to depend on nagios. Is that the case? If it is, I think we should remove that dependency - nagios-plugins doesn't actually need nagios to build properly, and in fact many people are building this project on machines that use remote agents (like NRPE/NCPA) or on competing monitoring cores (i.e. they use something other than Nagios Core to schedule checks/send notifications). I don't think we'd want to prevent those use cases in an official package.
Third, there was previously an official nagios-plugins package, which has since been replaced by the monitoring-plugins project. Were these packaging instructions based on those, or were they made completely separate? In general, I'd prefer not to see too much different behavior from what debian users are already expecting from a project like this.",True,{}

I've successfully built two .deb files for nagios-core and nagios-plugins using the above recipe and the 4 files of this PR put in the ./debian folder.
Built .deb Debian packages:

/root/install/nagios/nagios_4.4.6_all.deb
/root/install/nagios/nagios-plugins_2.3.3_all.deb

Install a completely fresh nagios-core instance with:
apt update
apt-get install -y apache2 apache2-utils build-essential daemon libapache2-mod-php libperl-dev libssl-dev make openssl perl php php-gd unzip wget
#
useradd nagios
groupadd nagcmd

nagios-core-4.4.6 debian APT package DEB files for dpkg","@sawolf Thank you very much for your reply.
First: I honestly don't know if it's standard. I just wanted to contribute the cooking recipe because it eases installation for Debian users a lot to have a maintained package.
Second: Ok, we can remove it.
Third: I've based this on nagios-plugins, I cloned that originally and made the packaging recipe for that.",True,{}
