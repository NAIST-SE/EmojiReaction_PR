Version 7.1.2
Released 2020-04-27

Revert applying shell quoting to commands for echo_with_pager and edit. This was intended to allows spaces in commands, but caused issues if the string was actually a command and arguments, or on Windows. Instead, the string must be quoted manually as it should appear on the command line. 1514

5.0.0 Penny - July 4, 2020
Breaking changes:

isort now requires Python 3.6+ to run but continues to support formatting on ALL versions of python including
Python 2 code.
isort deprecates official support for Python 3.4, removing modules only in this release from known_standard_library:

user


Config files are no longer composed on-top of each-other. Instead the first config file found is used.

Since there is no longer composition negative form settings (such as --dont-skip) are no longer required and have been removed.


Two-letter shortened setting names (like ac for atomic) now require two dashes to avoid ambiguity: --ac.
For consistency with other tools -v now is shorthand for verbose and -V is shorthand for version. See Issue: #1067.
length_sort_{section_name} config usage has been deprecated. Instead length_sort_sections list can be used to specify a list of sections that need to be length sorted.
safety_excludes and unsafe have been deprecated
Config now includes as default full set of safety directories defined by safety excludes.
--recursive option has been removed. Directories passed in are now automatically sorted recursive.
--apply option has been removed as it is the default behaviour.
isort now does nothing, beyond giving instructions and exiting status code 0, when ran with no arguments.

a new --interactive flag has been added to enable the old style behaviour.


isort now works on contiguous sections of imports, instead of one whole file at a time.
isort now formats all nested ""as"" imports in the ""from"" form. import x.y as a becomes from x import y as a.
keep_direct_and_as_imports option now defaults to True.
appdirs is no longer supported. Unless manually specified, config should be project config only.
toml is now installed as a vendorized module, meaning pyproject.toml based config is always supported.
Completely new Python API, old version is removed and no longer accessible.
New module placement logic and module fully replaces old finders. Old approach is still available via --old-finders.

Internal:


isort now utilizes mypy and typing to filter out typing related issues before deployment.


isort now utilizes black internally to ensure more consistent formatting.


profile support for common project types (black, django, google, etc)


Much much more. There is some difficulty in fully capturing the extent of changes in this release - just because of how all encompassing the release is. See: Github Issues for more.

Changelog
Sourced from isort's changelog.

5.0.3 - July 4, 2020

Fixed setup.py command incorrectly passing check=True as a configuration parameter (see: timothycrosley/isort#1258)
Fixed missing patch version
Fixed issue #1253: Atomic fails when passed in not readable output stream

5.0.2 - July 4, 2020

Ensured black profile was complete, adding missing line_length definition.

5.0.1 - July 4, 2020

Fixed a runtime error in a vendored dependency (toml).

5.0.0 Penny - July 4, 2020
Breaking changes:

isort now requires Python 3.6+ to run but continues to support formatting on ALL versions of python including
Python 2 code.
isort deprecates official support for Python 3.4, removing modules only in this release from known_standard_library:

user


Config files are no longer composed on-top of each-other. Instead the first config file found is used.

Since there is no longer composition negative form settings (such as --dont-skip) are no longer required and have been removed.


Two-letter shortened setting names (like ac for atomic) now require two dashes to avoid ambiguity: --ac.
For consistency with other tools -v now is shorthand for verbose and -V is shorthand for version. See Issue: #1067.
length_sort_{section_name} config usage has been deprecated. Instead length_sort_sections list can be used to specify a list of sections that need to be length sorted.
safety_excludes and unsafe have been deprecated
Config now includes as default full set of safety directories defined by safety excludes.
--recursive option has been removed. Directories passed in are now automatically sorted recursive.
--apply option has been removed as it is the default behaviour.
isort now does nothing, beyond giving instructions and exiting status code 0, when ran with no arguments.

a new --interactive flag has been added to enable the old style behaviour.


isort now works on contiguous sections of imports, instead of one whole file at a time.
isort now formats all nested ""as"" imports in the ""from"" form. import x.y as a becomes from x import y as a.
keep_direct_and_as_imports option now defaults to True.
appdirs is no longer supported. Unless manually specified, config should be project config only.
toml is now installed as a vendorized module, meaning pyproject.toml based config is always supported.
Completely new Python API, old version is removed and no longer accessible.
New module placement logic and module fully replaces old finders. Old approach is still available via --old-finders.

Internal:


isort now utilizes mypy and typing to filter out typing related issues before deployment.


isort now utilizes black internally to ensure more consistent formatting.


profile support for common project types (black, django, google, etc)


Much much more. There is some difficulty in fully capturing the extent of changes in this release - just because of how all encompassing the release is. See: Github Issues for more.

Completely new Python API, old version is removed and no longer accessible.
New module placement logic and module fully replaces old finders. Old approach is still available via --old-finders.

Internal:


isort now utilizes mypy and typing to filter out typing related issues before deployment.


isort now utilizes black internally to ensure more consistent formatting.


profile support for common project types (black, django, google, etc)


Much much more. There is some difficulty in fully capturing the extent of changes in this release - just because of how all encompassing the release is. See: Github Issues for more.

Breaking changes:

isort now requires Python 3.6+ to run but continues to support formatting on ALL versions of python including
Python 2 code.
isort deprecates official support for Python 3.4, removing modules only in this release from known_standard_library:

user


Config files are no longer composed on-top of each-other. Instead the first config file found is used.

Since there is no longer composition negative form settings (such as --dont-skip or it's config file variant not_skip) are no longer required and have been removed.


Two-letter shortened setting names (like ac for atomic) now require two dashes to avoid ambiguity: --ac.
For consistency with other tools -v now is shorthand for verbose and -V is shorthand for version. See Issue: #1067.
length_sort_{section_name} config usage has been deprecated. Instead length_sort_sections list can be used to specify a list of sections that need to be length sorted.
safety_excludes and unsafe have been deprecated
Config now includes as default full set of safety directories defined by safety excludes.
--recursive option has been removed. Directories passed in are now automatically sorted recursive.
--apply option has been removed as it is the default behaviour.
isort now does nothing, beyond giving instructions and exiting status code 0, when ran with no arguments.

a new --interactive flag has been added to enable the old style behaviour.


isort now works on contiguous sections of imports, instead of one whole file at a time.
isort now formats all nested ""as"" imports in the ""from"" form. import x.y as a becomes from x import y as a.
keep_direct_and_as_imports option now defaults to True.
appdirs is no longer supported. Unless manually specified, config should be project config only.

Config files are no longer composed on-top of each-other. Instead the first config file found is used.

Since there is no longer composition negative form settings (such as --dont-skip or it's config file variant not_skip) are no longer required and have been removed.


Two-letter shortened setting names (like ac for atomic) now require two dashes to avoid ambiguity: --ac.
For consistency with other tools -v now is shorthand for verbose and -V is shorthand for version. See Issue: #1067.
length_sort_{section_name} config usage has been deprecated. Instead length_sort_sections list can be used to specify a list of sections that need to be length sorted.
safety_excludes and unsafe have been deprecated
Config now includes as default full set of safety directories defined by safety excludes.
--recursive option has been removed. Directories passed in are now automatically sorted recursive.

Release notes
Sourced from isort's releases.

5.5.0 September 3, 2020

Fixed #1398: isort: off comment doesn't work, if it's the top comment in the file.
Fixed #1395: reverse_relative setting doesn't have any effect when combined with force_sort_within_sections.
Fixed #1399: --skip can error in the case of projects that contain recursive symlinks.
Fixed #1389: ensure_newline_before_comments doesn't work if comment is at top of section and sections don't have lines between them.
Fixed #1396: comments in imports with "";"" can keep isort from recognizing import line.
Fixed #1380: As imports removed when combine_star is set.
Fixed #1382: --float-to-top has no effect if no import is already at the top.
Fixed #1420: isort never settles on module docstring + add import.
Fixed #1421: Error raised when repo contains circular symlinks.
Fixed #1427: noqa comment is moved from star import to constant import.
Fixed #1444 & 1445: Incorrect placement of import additions.
Fixed #1447: isort5 throws error when stdin used on Windows with deprecated args.

Release notes
Sourced from isort's releases.

5.5.1 September 4, 2020

Fixed #1454: Ensure indented import sections with import heading and a preceding comment don't cause import sorting loops.
Fixed #1453: isort error when float to top on almost empty file.
Fixed #1456 and #1415: noqa comment moved to where flake8 cant see it.
Fixed #1460: .svn missing from default ignore list.

5.5.0 September 3, 2020

Fixed #1398: isort: off comment doesn't work, if it's the top comment in the file.
Fixed #1395: reverse_relative setting doesn't have any effect when combined with force_sort_within_sections.
Fixed #1399: --skip can error in the case of projects that contain recursive symlinks.
Fixed #1389: ensure_newline_before_comments doesn't work if comment is at top of section and sections don't have lines between them.
Fixed #1396: comments in imports with "";"" can keep isort from recognizing import line.
Fixed #1380: As imports removed when combine_star is set.
Fixed #1382: --float-to-top has no effect if no import is already at the top.
Fixed #1420: isort never settles on module docstring + add import.
Fixed #1421: Error raised when repo contains circular symlinks.
Fixed #1427: noqa comment is moved from star import to constant import.
Fixed #1444 & 1445: Incorrect placement of import additions.
Fixed #1447: isort5 throws error when stdin used on Windows with deprecated args.
Implemented #1397: Added support for specifying config file when using git hook (thanks @diseraluca!).
Implemented #1405: Added support for coloring diff output.
Implemented #1434: New multi-line grid mode without parentheses.

Goal Zero (Tickets related to aspirational goal of achieving 0 regressions for remaining 5.0.0 lifespan):

Implemented #1392: Extensive profile testing.
Implemented #1393: Proprety based testing applied to code snippets.
Implemented #1391: Create automated integration test that includes full code base of largest OpenSource isort users.

Potentially breaking changes:

Fixed #1429: --check doesn't print to stderr as the documentation says. This means if you were looking for ERROR: messages for files that contain incorrect imports within stdout you will now need to look in stderr.

5.4.2 Aug 14, 2020

Fixed #1383: Known other does not work anymore with .editorconfig.
Fixed: Regression in first known party path expansion.

5.4.1 [Hotfix] Aug 13, 2020

Release notes
Sourced from isort's releases.

5.5.2 [Hotfix] September 9, 2020

Fixed #1469: --diff option is ignored when input is from stdin.

5.5.1 September 4, 2020

Fixed #1454: Ensure indented import sections with import heading and a preceding comment don't cause import sorting loops.
Fixed #1453: isort error when float to top on almost empty file.
Fixed #1456 and #1415: noqa comment moved to where flake8 cant see it.
Fixed #1460: .svn missing from default ignore list.

5.5.0 September 3, 2020

Fixed #1398: isort: off comment doesn't work, if it's the top comment in the file.
Fixed #1395: reverse_relative setting doesn't have any effect when combined with force_sort_within_sections.
Fixed #1399: --skip can error in the case of projects that contain recursive symlinks.
Fixed #1389: ensure_newline_before_comments doesn't work if comment is at top of section and sections don't have lines between them.
Fixed #1396: comments in imports with "";"" can keep isort from recognizing import line.
Fixed #1380: As imports removed when combine_star is set.
Fixed #1382: --float-to-top has no effect if no import is already at the top.
Fixed #1420: isort never settles on module docstring + add import.
Fixed #1421: Error raised when repo contains circular symlinks.
Fixed #1427: noqa comment is moved from star import to constant import.
Fixed #1444 & 1445: Incorrect placement of import additions.
Fixed #1447: isort5 throws error when stdin used on Windows with deprecated args.
Implemented #1397: Added support for specifying config file when using git hook (thanks @diseraluca!).
Implemented #1405: Added support for coloring diff output.
Implemented #1434: New multi-line grid mode without parentheses.

Goal Zero (Tickets related to aspirational goal of achieving 0 regressions for remaining 5.0.0 lifespan):

Implemented #1392: Extensive profile testing.
Implemented #1393: Proprety based testing applied to code snippets.
Implemented #1391: Create automated integration test that includes full code base of largest OpenSource isort users.

Potentially breaking changes:

Fixed #1429: --check doesn't print to stderr as the documentation says. This means if you were looking for ERROR: messages for files that contain incorrect imports within stdout you will now need to look in stderr.

5.4.2 Aug 14, 2020

Fixed #1383: Known other does not work anymore with .editorconfig.
Fixed: Regression in first known party path expansion.

5.4.1 [Hotfix] Aug 13, 2020

Release notes
Sourced from isort's releases.

5.5.3 [Hotfix] September 20, 2020

Fixed #1488: in rare cases isort can mangle yield from or raise from statements.

5.5.2 [Hotfix] September 9, 2020

Fixed #1469: --diff option is ignored when input is from stdin.

5.5.1 September 4, 2020

Fixed #1454: Ensure indented import sections with import heading and a preceding comment don't cause import sorting loops.
Fixed #1453: isort error when float to top on almost empty file.
Fixed #1456 and #1415: noqa comment moved to where flake8 cant see it.
Fixed #1460: .svn missing from default ignore list.

5.5.0 September 3, 2020

Fixed #1398: isort: off comment doesn't work, if it's the top comment in the file.
Fixed #1395: reverse_relative setting doesn't have any effect when combined with force_sort_within_sections.
Fixed #1399: --skip can error in the case of projects that contain recursive symlinks.
Fixed #1389: ensure_newline_before_comments doesn't work if comment is at top of section and sections don't have lines between them.
Fixed #1396: comments in imports with "";"" can keep isort from recognizing import line.
Fixed #1380: As imports removed when combine_star is set.
Fixed #1382: --float-to-top has no effect if no import is already at the top.
Fixed #1420: isort never settles on module docstring + add import.
Fixed #1421: Error raised when repo contains circular symlinks.
Fixed #1427: noqa comment is moved from star import to constant import.
Fixed #1444 & 1445: Incorrect placement of import additions.

Release notes
Sourced from isort's releases.

5.5.4 [Hotfix] September 29, 2020

Fixed #1507: in rare cases isort changes the content of multiline strings after a yield statement.
Fixed #1505: Support case where known_SECTION points to a section not listed in sections.

5.5.3 [Hotfix] September 20, 2020

Fixed #1488: in rare cases isort can mangle yield from or raise from statements.

5.5.2 [Hotfix] September 9, 2020

Fixed #1469: --diff option is ignored when input is from stdin.

5.5.1 September 4, 2020

Fixed #1454: Ensure indented import sections with import heading and a preceding comment don't cause import sorting loops.
Fixed #1453: isort error when float to top on almost empty file.
Fixed #1456 and #1415: noqa comment moved to where flake8 cant see it.
Fixed #1460: .svn missing from default ignore list.

5.5.0 September 3, 2020

Fixed #1398: isort: off comment doesn't work, if it's the top comment in the file.
Fixed #1395: reverse_relative setting doesn't have any effect when combined with force_sort_within_sections.
Fixed #1399: --skip can error in the case of projects that contain recursive symlinks.
Fixed #1389: ensure_newline_before_comments doesn't work if comment is at top of section and sections don't have lines between them.
Fixed #1396: comments in imports with "";"" can keep isort from recognizing import line.
Fixed #1380: As imports removed when combine_star is set.
Fixed #1382: --float-to-top has no effect if no import is already at the top.
Fixed #1420: isort never settles on module docstring + add import.
Fixed #1421: Error raised when repo contains circular symlinks.
Fixed #1427: noqa comment is moved from star import to constant import.
Fixed #1444 & 1445: Incorrect placement of import additions.
Fixed #1447: isort5 throws error when stdin used on Windows with deprecated args.
Implemented #1397: Added support for specifying config file when using git hook (thanks @diseraluca!).
Implemented #1405: Added support for coloring diff output.
Implemented #1434: New multi-line grid mode without parentheses.

Goal Zero (Tickets related to aspirational goal of achieving 0 regressions for remaining 5.0.0 lifespan):

Implemented #1392: Extensive profile testing.
Implemented #1393: Proprety based testing applied to code snippets.
Implemented #1391: Create automated integration test that includes full code base of largest OpenSource isort users.

Potentially breaking changes:

Fixed #1429: --check doesn't print to stderr as the documentation says. This means if you were looking for ERROR: messages for files that contain incorrect imports within stdout you will now need to look in stderr.

5.4.2 Aug 14, 2020

Fixed #1383: Known other does not work anymore with .editorconfig.
Fixed: Regression in first known party path expansion.

5.4.1 [Hotfix] Aug 13, 2020

Fixed #1381: --combine-as loses # noqa in different circumstances.

5.4.0 Aug 12, 2020

Implemented #1373: support for length sort only of direct (AKA straight) imports.

Fixed #1398: isort: off comment doesn't work, if it's the top comment in the file.
Fixed #1395: reverse_relative setting doesn't have any effect when combined with force_sort_within_sections.
Fixed #1399: --skip can error in the case of projects that contain recursive symlinks.
Fixed #1389: ensure_newline_before_comments doesn't work if comment is at top of section and sections don't have lines between them.
Fixed #1396: comments in imports with "";"" can keep isort from recognizing import line.
Fixed #1380: As imports removed when combine_star is set.
Fixed #1382: --float-to-top has no effect if no import is already at the top.
Fixed #1420: isort never settles on module docstring + add import.
Fixed #1421: Error raised when repo contains circular symlinks.
Fixed #1427: noqa comment is moved from star import to constant import.
Fixed #1444 & 1445: Incorrect placement of import additions.
Fixed #1447: isort5 throws error when stdin used on Windows with deprecated args.
Implemented #1397: Added support for specifying config file when using git hook (thanks @diseraluca!).
Implemented #1405: Added support for coloring diff output.
Implemented #1434: New multi-line grid mode without parentheses.

Goal Zero (Tickets related to aspirational goal of achieving 0 regressions for remaining 5.0.0 lifespan):

Implemented #1392: Extensive profile testing.
Implemented #1393: Proprety based testing applied to code snippets.
Implemented #1391: Create automated integration test that includes full code base of largest OpenSource isort users.

Potentially breaking changes:

Fixed #1429: --check doesn't print to stderr as the documentation says. This means if you were looking for ERROR: messages for files that contain incorrect imports within stdout you will now need to look in stderr.

5.4.2 Aug 14, 2020

Fixed #1383: Known other does not work anymore with .editorconfig.
Fixed: Regression in first known party path expansion.

5.4.1 [Hotfix] Aug 13, 2020

Fixed #1381: --combine-as loses # noqa in different circumstances.

5.4.0 Aug 12, 2020

Implemented #1373: support for length sort only of direct (AKA straight) imports.

Fixed #1525: Some warnings can't be disabled with --quiet.
Fixed #1523: in rare cases isort can ignore direct from import if as import is also on same line.

Potentially breaking changes:

Implemented #1540: Officially support Python 3.9 stdlib imports by default.
Fixed #1443: Incorrect third vs first party categorization - namespace packages.
Fixed #1486: ""Google"" profile is not quite Google style.
Fixed ""PyCharm"" profile to always add 2 lines to be consistent with what PyCharm ""Optimize Imports"" does.

Goal Zero: (Tickets related to aspirational goal of achieving 0 regressions for remaining 5.0.0 lifespan):

Implemented #1472: Full testing of stdin CLI Options
Added additional branch coverage.
More projects added to integration test suite.

Black


Fixed a rare but annoying formatting instability created by the combination of
optional trailing commas inserted by Black and optional parentheses looking at
pre-existing ""magic"" trailing commas. This fixes issue #1629 and all of its many many
duplicates. (#2126)


Black now processes one-line docstrings by stripping leading and trailing spaces,
and adding a padding space when needed to break up """""""". (#1740)


Black now cleans up leading non-breaking spaces in comments (#2092)


Black now respects --skip-string-normalization when normalizing multiline
docstring quotes (#1637)


Black no longer removes all empty lines between non-function code and decorators
when formatting typing stubs. Now Black enforces a single empty line. (#1646)


Black no longer adds an incorrect space after a parenthesized assignment expression
in if/while statements (#1655)


Added --skip-magic-trailing-comma / -C to avoid using trailing commas as a reason
to split lines (#1824)


fixed a crash when PWD=/ on POSIX (#1631)


fixed ""I/O operation on closed file"" when using --diff (#1664)


Prevent coloured diff output being interleaved with multiple files (#1673)


Added support for PEP 614 relaxed decorator syntax on python 3.9 (#1711)


Added parsing support for unparenthesized tuples and yield expressions in annotated
assignments (#1835)


use lowercase hex strings (#1692)


added --extend-exclude argument (PR #2005)


speed up caching by avoiding pathlib (#1950)


--diff correctly indicates when a file doesn't end in a newline (#1662)


Added --stdin-filename argument to allow stdin to respect --force-exclude rules
(#1780)


Lines ending with fmt: skip will now be not formatted (#1800)

being called but with no arguments (#2182)

Black-Primer

Add --no-diff to black-primer to suppress formatting changes (#2187)

21.4b2
Black


Fix crash if the user configuration directory is inaccessible. (#2158)

Black


Fix crash on docstrings ending with ""\ "". (#2142)


Fix crash when atypical whitespace is cleaned out of dostrings (#2120)


Reflect the --skip-magic-trailing-comma and --experimental-string-processing flags
in the name of the cache file. Without this fix, changes in these flags would not take
effect if the cache had already been populated. (#2131)


Don't remove necessary parentheses from assignment expression containing assert /
return statements. (#2143)


Packaging

Bump pathspec to >= 0.8.1 to solve invalid .gitignore exclusion handling

21.4b0
Black

Fixed a rare but annoying formatting instability created by the combination of
optional trailing commas inserted by Black and optional parentheses looking at
pre-existing ""magic"" trailing commas. This fixes issue #1629 and all of its many many
duplicates. (#2126)

Version 8.0.0
Released 2021-05-11

Drop support for Python 2 and 3.5.
Colorama is always installed on Windows in order to provide style
and color support. :pr:1784
Adds a repr to Command, showing the command name for friendlier
debugging. :issue:1267, :pr:1295
Add support for distinguishing the source of a command line
parameter. :issue:1264, :pr:1329
Add an optional parameter to ProgressBar.update to set the
current_item. :issue:1226, :pr:1332
version_option uses importlib.metadata (or the
importlib_metadata backport) instead of pkg_resources.
:issue:1582
If validation fails for a prompt with hide_input=True, the value
is not shown in the error message. :issue:1460
An IntRange or FloatRange option shows the accepted range in
its help text. :issue:1525, :pr:1303
IntRange and FloatRange bounds can be open (<) instead
of closed (<=) by setting min_open and max_open. Error
messages have changed to reflect this. :issue:1100
An option defined with duplicate flag names (""--foo/--foo"")
raises a ValueError. :issue:1465
echo() will not fail when using pytest's capsys fixture on
Windows. :issue:1590
Resolving commands returns the canonical command name instead of the
matched name. This makes behavior such as help text and
Context.invoked_subcommand consistent when using patterns like
AliasedGroup. :issue:1422
The BOOL type accepts the values ""on"" and ""off"". :issue:1629
A Group with invoke_without_command=True will always invoke
its result callback. :issue:1178
nargs == -1 and nargs > 1 is parsed and validated for
values from environment variables and defaults. :issue:729
Detect the program name when executing a module or package with
python -m name. :issue:1603
Include required parent arguments in help synopsis of subcommands.
:issue:1475
Help for boolean flags with show_default=True shows the flag
name instead of True or False. :issue:1538
Non-string objects passed to style() and secho() will be
converted to string. :pr:1146
edit(require_save=True) will detect saves for editors that exit
very fast on filesystems with 1 second resolution. :pr:1050
New class attributes make it easier to use custom core objects
throughout an entire application. :pr:938

Version 8.0.0
Released 2021-05-11

Drop support for Python 2 and 3.5.
Colorama is always installed on Windows in order to provide style
and color support. :pr:1784
Adds a repr to Command, showing the command name for friendlier
debugging. :issue:1267, :pr:1295
Add support for distinguishing the source of a command line
parameter. :issue:1264, :pr:1329
Add an optional parameter to ProgressBar.update to set the
current_item. :issue:1226, :pr:1332
version_option uses importlib.metadata (or the
importlib_metadata backport) instead of pkg_resources.
:issue:1582
If validation fails for a prompt with hide_input=True, the value
is not shown in the error message. :issue:1460
An IntRange or FloatRange option shows the accepted range in
its help text. :issue:1525, :pr:1303
IntRange and FloatRange bounds can be open (<) instead
of closed (<=) by setting min_open and max_open. Error
messages have changed to reflect this. :issue:1100
An option defined with duplicate flag names (""--foo/--foo"")
raises a ValueError. :issue:1465
echo() will not fail when using pytest's capsys fixture on
Windows. :issue:1590
Resolving commands returns the canonical command name instead of the
matched name. This makes behavior such as help text and
Context.invoked_subcommand consistent when using patterns like
AliasedGroup. :issue:1422
The BOOL type accepts the values ""on"" and ""off"". :issue:1629
A Group with invoke_without_command=True will always invoke
its result callback. :issue:1178
nargs == -1 and nargs > 1 is parsed and validated for
values from environment variables and defaults. :issue:729
Detect the program name when executing a module or package with
python -m name. :issue:1603
Include required parent arguments in help synopsis of subcommands.
:issue:1475
Help for boolean flags with show_default=True shows the flag
name instead of True or False. :issue:1538
Non-string objects passed to style() and secho() will be
converted to string. :pr:1146
edit(require_save=True) will detect saves for editors that exit
very fast on filesystems with 1 second resolution. :pr:1050
New class attributes make it easier to use custom core objects
throughout an entire application. :pr:938

Version 8.0.1
Released 2021-05-19

Mark top-level names as exported so type checking understand imports
in user projects. :issue:1879
Annotate Context.obj as Any so type checking allows all
operations on the arbitrary object. :issue:1885
Fix some types that weren't available in Python 3.6.0. :issue:1882
Fix type checking for iterating over ProgressBar object.
:issue:1892
The importlib_metadata backport package is installed on Python <
3.8. :issue:1889
Arguments with nargs=-1 only use env var value if no command
line values are given. :issue:1903
Flag options guess their type from flag_value if given, like
regular options do from default. :issue:1886
Added documentation that custom parameter types may be passed
already valid values in addition to strings. :issue:1898
Resolving commands returns the name that was given, not
command.name, fixing an unintended change to help text and
default_map lookups. When using patterns like AliasedGroup,
override resolve_command to change the name that is returned if
needed. :issue:1895
If a default value is invalid, it does not prevent showing help
text. :issue:1889
Pass windows_expand_args=False when calling the main command to
disable pattern expansion on Windows. There is no way to escape
patterns in CMD, so if the program needs to pass them on as-is then
expansion must be disabled. :issue:1901

Feature: support M1 Catalyst. (conan-io/conan#8818)
Feature: New conan install <ref> --build-require and conan create <path> --build-require  (when not using test_package) arguments to explicitly define that the installed or created package has to be a build-require, receiving the build profile instead of the host one. (conan-io/conan#8627)
Feature: Introduced the layout() method to the recipe to be able to declare the folder structure both for the local development methods (conan source, conan build...) and in the cache. Also, associated to the folders, cppinfo objects to be used in editable packages and file pattern descriptions to enable ""auto packaging"". (conan-io/conan#8554). Docs: 📃
Fix: CMakeDeps generator: The transitive requirements for a build_require are not included in the xxx-config.cmake files generated. (conan-io/conan#9015)
Fix: The CMakeToolchain now supports Apple M1 cross-building with a profile without environment declared pointing to the system toolchain. (conan-io/conan#9011)

Release notes
Sourced from conan's releases.

1.37.1 (08-Jun-2021)

Fix: Update the experimental conan new ... -m=v2_cmake template to start using the new layout() basic info. (conan-io/conan#9053)
Fix: Do not fail in CMakeDeps when there are build_requires with same name as host requires, unless build_context_activated is enabled for those and a different suffix has not been defined. (conan-io/conan#9046)
Fix: When using the new self.folders.source (at layout(self) method) the sources (from export, export_sources and scm) are copied to the base source folder and not to the self.folders.source that is intended to describe where the sources are after fetching them. (conan-io/conan#9043). Docs: 📃
BugFix: Do not quote all values and allow integer and macro referencing in MSBuildToolchain.preprocessor_definitions (conan-io/conan#9056)
Bugfix: The new generators like CMakeDeps and CMakeToolchainwrite the generated files defaulting to the install folder if no self.folders.generators is specified in the layout() method. (conan-io/conan#9050)

1.37.0 (31-May-2021)

Feature: Remove CMAKE_SKIP_RPATHS by default to True in CMakeToolchain, it is not necessary by default, users can opt-in, and new test validates shared libs will work with VirtualEnv generator conanrunenv. (conan-io/conan#9024). Docs: 📃
Feature: simplified CMakeToolchain with only 1 category of blocks, made try-compile template code as another block, and reordered blocks so relevant flags for try-compile are taken into account. (conan-io/conan#9009). Docs: 📃

Docs: 📃
Feature: Expand user-agent string to include OS info. (conan-io/conan#8947)
Feature: Implement build_policy=never for conan export-pkg packages that cannot be rebuilt with --build=xxx. (conan-io/conan#8946). Docs: 📃
Feature: Define [conf] for defining the user toolchain for CMakeToolchain, both for injecting a user toolchain in the CMakeToolchain generated conan_toolchain.cmake and for completely replacing conan_toolchain.cmake. (conan-io/conan#8945). Docs: 📃

Feature: Build-requires can define [conf] for its consumers. (conan-io/conan#8895). Docs: 📃
Feature: support M1 Catalyst. (conan-io/conan#8818)
Feature: New conan install <ref> --build-require and conan create <path> --build-require  (when not using test_package) arguments to explicitly define that the installed or created package has to be a build-require, receiving the build profile instead of the host one. (conan-io/conan#8627). Docs: 📃
Feature: Introduced the layout() method to the recipe to be able to declare the folder structure both for the local development methods (conan source, conan build...) and in the cache. Also, associated to the folders, cppinfo objects to be used in editable packages and file pattern descriptions to enable ""auto packaging"". (conan-io/conan#8554). Docs: 📃
Fix: CMakeDeps generator: The transitive requirements for a build_require are not included in the xxx-config.cmake files generated. (conan-io/conan#9015)
Fix: The CMakeToolchain now supports Apple M1 cross-building with a profile without environment declared pointing to the system toolchain. (conan-io/conan#9011)

Docs: 📃
Feature: Expand user-agent string to include OS info. (conan-io/conan#8947)
Feature: Implement build_policy=never for conan export-pkg packages that cannot be rebuilt with --build=xxx. (conan-io/conan#8946). Docs: 📃
Feature: Define [conf] for defining the user toolchain for CMakeToolchain, both for injecting a user toolchain in the CMakeToolchain generated conan_toolchain.cmake and for completely replacing conan_toolchain.cmake. (conan-io/conan#8945). Docs: 📃

Feature: Introduced the layout() method to the recipe to be able to declare the folder structure both for the local development methods (conan source, conan build...) and in the cache. Also, associated to the folders, cppinfo objects to be used in editable packages and file pattern descriptions to enable ""auto packaging"". (conan-io/conan#8554). Docs: 📃
Fix: CMakeDeps generator: The transitive requirements for a build_require are not included in the xxx-config.cmake files generated. (conan-io/conan#9015)
Fix: The CMakeToolchain now supports Apple M1 cross-building with a profile without environment declared pointing to the system toolchain. (conan-io/conan#9011)

Release notes
Sourced from conan's releases.

1.38.0 (30-Jun-2021)

Feature: New PkgConfigDeps generator. (conan-io/conan#9152). Docs: 📃
Feature: Proposal of jinja2 templates for profiles. (conan-io/conan#9147). Docs: 📃
Feature: Add support for CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED in CMakeToolchain. (conan-io/conan#9144)
Feature: Add context information to conan info output both to stdout and json outputs. (conan-io/conan#9137). Docs: 📃
Feature: Improved the new AutotoolsToolchain, AutotoolsDeps and Autotools build helper. (conan-io/conan#9131). Docs: 📃
Feature: Initial cross-build support in CMakeToolchain with definition of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME, CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR and CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION, deduced from self.settings_build (only using the 2 profiles) and from new [conf] items. (conan-io/conan#9115). Docs: 📃
Feature: Easier access to modify or update context values in CMakeToolchain blocks. (conan-io/conan#9109). Docs: 📃
Feature: Provide [conf] command line support. (conan-io/conan#9103). Docs: 📃
Feature: Added support for using server config from a custom location, setting CONAN_SERVER_HOME env variable or using -d or --server_dir flag when launching the server with conan_server command. (conan-io/conan#9099). Docs: 📃
Feature: Support for CMakeDeps generator of a new property ""skip_deps_file"" to be declared in the cpp_info of a package to skip creating xxx-config.cmake files for it, allowing to create ""system wrapper"" recipes easily. (conan-io/conan#9087). Docs: 📃
Feature: New conanfile.dependencies model, using a dict {requirement: ConanFileInterface} to prepare for Conan 2.0. (conan-io/conan#9062). Docs: 📃
Feature: Allow a explicit requires = ""pkg..#recipe_revision"" to update cache revision without --update. (conan-io/conan#9058). Docs: 📃
Feature: New cmake_layout() layout helper to define a multi-platform CMake layout that will work for different generators (ninja, xcode, visual, unix), and is multi-config. (conan-io/conan#9057). Docs: 📃
Feature: The conan_toolchain.cmake now includes xxx_DIR variables for the dependencies to ease the find_package mechanism to locate them. The declaration of these directories is a must when cross-building in OSX where CMake ignores CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH and CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to look only at the system framework directories. (conan-io/conan#9032). Docs: 📃
Feature: Provide access in the recipes to the environment declared with the new environment system. (conan-io/conan#9030). Docs: 📃
Fix: Fix Bazel build string defines. (conan-io/conan#9139)
Fix: Fixed behavior in the self.folders feature whereby the sources saved or downloaded inside the source(self) were saved at the self.folders.source folder. But self.folders.source is intended to describe where the sources are instead of forcing where the sources are saved. (conan-io/conan#9124). Docs: 📃
Fix: Properly generate qbs profile for msvc. (conan-io/conan#9122)
Fix: Configuration general.user_home_short works with ""None"" value. (conan-io/conan#9118)
Fix: Avoid CMakeToolchain to generate OSX and Apple config for non Apple builds. (conan-io/conan#9107)
Fix: The new MesonToolchain now takes the declared environment variables (CC, CXX...) from build-requires and profiles to set the variables c, cpp, c_ld, cpp_ld etc, into the conan_meson_native.ini (conan-io/conan#8353). Docs: 📃
Fix: Added new preprocessor_definitions to new Meson build helper. (conan-io/conan#8353). Docs: 📃
Fix: The new MesonToolchain now allows adjusting any variable before generating the conan_meson_native.ini file. (conan-io/conan#8353). Docs: 📃
Bugfix: Disabled remotes shouldn't fail if not used at all (conan-io/conan#9184)
BugFix: ConanFileDependencies.build[""dep""] was retrieving the host dependency if existing, or failing otherwise, because the default requires was hardcoded to fetch the host (build=False) dependency. (conan-io/conan#9148). Docs: 📃
Bugfix: Now, conan profile {show, update, get, remove} is working fine with new experimental [conf] section. (conan-io/conan#9114)

1.37.2 (14-Jun-2021)

Bugfix: Avoid crash when using --lockfile with the conan test command. (conan-io/conan#9089)
Bugfix: The CMakeDeps generator variables were named wrongly when a component had the same name as the package. (conan-io/conan#9073)

1.37.1 (08-Jun-2021)

Fix: Update the experimental conan new ... -m=v2_cmake template to start using the new layout() basic info. (conan-io/conan#9053)
Fix: Do not fail in CMakeDeps when there are build_requires with same name as host requires, unless build_context_activated is enabled for those and a different suffix has not been defined. (conan-io/conan#9046)
Fix: When using the new self.folders.source (at layout(self) method) the sources (from export, export_sources and scm) are copied to the base source folder and not to the self.folders.source that is intended to describe where the sources are after fetching them. (conan-io/conan#9043). Docs: 📃
BugFix: Do not quote all values and allow integer and macro referencing in MSBuildToolchain.preprocessor_definitions (conan-io/conan#9056)
Bugfix: The new generators like CMakeDeps and CMakeToolchainwrite the generated files defaulting to the install folder if no self.folders.generators is specified in the layout() method. (conan-io/conan#9050)
Bugfix: The CMakeToolchain generator now manages correctly a recipe without arch declared in an Apple system. (conan-io/conan#9045)

1.37.0 (31-May-2021)

Feature: Remove CMAKE_SKIP_RPATHS by default to True in CMakeToolchain, it is not necessary by default, users can opt-in, and new test validates shared libs will work with VirtualEnv generator conanrunenv. (conan-io/conan#9024). Docs: 📃
Feature: simplified CMakeToolchain with only 1 category of blocks, made try-compile template code as another block, and reordered blocks so relevant flags for try-compile are taken into account. (conan-io/conan#9009). Docs: 📃
Feature: Add new default conancenter remote for https://center.conan.io as first in the list. (conan-io/conan#8999). Docs: 📃
Feature: Implements a new experimental conan.tools.google Bazel integration with BazelDeps, BazelToolchain and Bazel. (conan-io/conan#8991). Docs: 📃
Feature: Introduced new options for the CMakeDeps generator allowing to manage build_requires even declaring the same package as a require and build_require avoiding the collision of the config cmake files and enabling to specify which build_modules should be included (e.g protobuf issue) (conan-io/conan#8985). Docs: 📃
Feature: Expand user-agent string to include OS info. (conan-io/conan#8947)
Feature: Implement build_policy=never for conan export-pkg packages that cannot be rebuilt with --build=xxx. (conan-io/conan#8946). Docs: 📃
Feature: Define [conf] for defining the user toolchain for CMakeToolchain, both for injecting a user toolchain in the CMakeToolchain generated conan_toolchain.cmake and for completely replacing conan_toolchain.cmake. (conan-io/conan#8945). Docs: 📃
Feature: add GCC 11 to settings.yml. (conan-io/conan#8924)

Feature: Provide access in the recipes to the environment declared with the new environment system. (conan-io/conan#9030). Docs: 📃
Fix: Fix Bazel build string defines. (conan-io/conan#9139)
Fix: Fixed behavior in the self.folders feature whereby the sources saved or downloaded inside the source(self) were saved at the self.folders.source folder.

Fix: The new MesonToolchain now allows adjusting any variable before generating the conan_meson_native.ini file. (conan-io/conan#8353). Docs: 📃
Bugfix: Disabled remotes shouldn't fail if not used at all (conan-io/conan#9184)
BugFix: ConanFileDependencies.build[""dep""] was retrieving the host dependency if existing, or failing otherwise, because the default requires was hardcoded to fetch the host (build=False) dependency. (conan-io/conan#9148). Docs: 📃
Bugfix: Now, conan profile {show, update, get, remove} is working fine with new experimental [conf] section. (conan-io/conan#9114)

1.37.2 (14-Jun-2021)

Bugfix: Avoid crash when using --lockfile with the conan test command. (conan-io/conan#9089)

1.37.1 (08-Jun-2021)

Fix: Update the experimental conan new ... -m=v2_cmake template to start using the new layout() basic info. (conan-io/conan#9053)
Fix: Do not fail in CMakeDeps when there are build_requires with same name as host requires, unless build_context_activated is enabled for those and a different suffix has not been defined. (conan-io/conan#9046)
Fix: When using the new self.folders.source (at layout(self) method) the sources (from export, export_sources and scm) are copied to the base source folder and not to the self.folders.source that is intended to describe where the sources are after fetching them. (conan-io/conan#9043). Docs: 📃
BugFix: Do not quote all values and allow integer and macro referencing in MSBuildToolchain.preprocessor_definitions (conan-io/conan#9056)
Bugfix: The new generators like CMakeDeps and CMakeToolchainwrite the generated files defaulting to the install folder if no self.folders.generators is specified in the layout() method. (conan-io/conan#9050)
Bugfix: The CMakeToolchain generator now manages correctly a recipe without arch declared in an Apple system. (conan-io/conan#9045)

1.37.0 (31-May-2021)

Feature: Remove CMAKE_SKIP_RPATHS by default to True in CMakeToolchain, it is not necessary by default, users can opt-in, and new test validates shared libs will work with VirtualEnv generator conanrunenv. (conan-io/conan#9024). Docs: 📃
Feature: simplified CMakeToolchain with only 1 category of blocks, made try-compile template code as another block, and reordered blocks so relevant flags for try-compile are taken into account. (conan-io/conan#9009). Docs: 📃
Feature: Add new default conancenter remote for https://center.conan.io as first in the list. (conan-io/conan#8999). Docs: 📃

Feature: Introduced new options for the CMakeDeps generator allowing to manage build_requires even declaring the same package as a require and build_require avoiding the collision of the config cmake files and enabling to specify which build_modules should be included (e.g protobuf issue) (conan-io/conan#8985). Docs: 📃
Feature: Expand user-agent string to include OS info. (conan-io/conan#8947)
Feature: Implement build_policy=never for conan export-pkg packages that cannot be rebuilt with --build=xxx. (conan-io/conan#8946). Docs: 📃
Feature: Define [conf] for defining the user toolchain for CMakeToolchain, both for injecting a user toolchain in the CMakeToolchain generated conan_toolchain.cmake and for completely replacing conan_toolchain.cmake. (conan-io/conan#8945). Docs: 📃
Feature: add GCC 11 to settings.yml. (conan-io/conan#8924)

Release notes
Sourced from conan's releases.

1.39.0 (27-Jul-2021)

Feature: Use CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to get -version-min set in CMakeToolchain. (conan-io/conan#9301)
Feature: Display python_requires information in the conan info output. (conan-io/conan#9290)
Feature: Now it is possible to define settings for a downstream consumer using -s &:setting=value or the same syntax in the profile even if the consumer is a conanfile.txt or a conanfile.py not declaring a name. e.g: Building a Debug application with Release dependencies: -s build_type=Release -s &:build_type=Debug (conan-io/conan#9267). Docs: 📃
Feature: The AutotoolsDeps allows to alter the generated environment corresponding to the information read from the dependencies before calling the generate() method. (conan-io/conan#9256). Docs: 📃
Feature: new remove and items methods for the Environment objects. (conan-io/conan#9256). Docs: 📃
Feature: New VCVars generator that generates a conanvcvars.bat that activates the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt. (conan-io/conan#9230). Docs: 📃
Feature: Skip build helper test and using [conf]. (conan-io/conan#9218). Docs: 📃
Feature: Implement a new requires = ""pkg/(alias)"" syntax to be able to dissambiguate alias requirements and resolve them earlier in the flow, solving some limitations of the previous alias definition. This approach is intended to be the one in Conan 2.0 (issue backported from conan-io/tribe#25). (conan-io/conan#9217). Docs: 📃
Feature: Introduce the -require-override argument to define dependency overrides directly on command line. (conan-io/conan#9195). Docs: 📃
Feature: New self.win_bash mechanism to enable running commands in a bash shell in Windows. It works only with the new environment definition from the dependencies (env_buildinfo and run_buildinfo) as long as the new AutotoolsToolchain, AutotoolsDeps and Autotools build helper. It supports automatic conversion of the environment variables values declared as ""path"" according to the declared subsystem in the conf tools.win.bash:subsystem, that is not being auto-detected anymore. (conan-io/conan#9194). Docs: 📃
Feature: A unique environment launcher (conanenv.bat/sh) is generated to aggregate all the environment generators (VirtualRunEnv, VirtualBuildEnv, AutotoolsToolchain and AutotoolsDeps) that had been generated so the user can easily activate all of them with one command. (conan-io/conan#9161). Docs: 📃
Feature: Use CMake File API. (conan-io/conan#9005)
Fix: Add bindirs definition to cmake_layout(). (conan-io/conan#9276)
Fix: Improve error message when conan search <ref> a package in editable mode. (conan-io/conan#9262)
Fix: Add options to conanfile.dependencies model. (conan-io/conan#9258)
Fix: Fix CMake rejecting library name with special characters. (conan-io/conan#9245)
Fix: Use filename [PKG-NAME]-[COMP-NAME] for PkgConfigDeps. (conan-io/conan#9228). Docs: 📃
Fix: Saving all the toolchain args information into conanbuild.conf instead of json file. (conan-io/conan#9225). Docs: 📃
Fix: Added warning in the new toolchains (the used in the generate() method) if no build profile is being used. (conan-io/conan#9206). Docs: 📃
Fix: Implemented check that will raise an error in the CMakeDeps generator when using the build_context_activated, build_context_suffix or build_context_build_modules attributes if no build profile is being used. (conan-io/conan#9206). Docs: 📃
Fix: TheCMakeDeps generator will check if the targets specified in the find_package(foo components x y z) exist instead of checking against an internal variable. Also, this check will be done at the end of the xxx-config.cmake so any included build_module can declare the needed targets. (conan-io/conan#9206). Docs: 📃
Fix: Consistent help message for conan profile (sub-command part). (conan-io/conan#9204). Docs: 📃
Fix: Consistently put short arguments (-a) before long ones (--args). (conan-io/conan#9199)
Fix: CC=clang --gcc-toolchain is now identified as clang. (conan-io/conan#9198)
Fix: The new VirtualEnv generator has been split into VirtualRunEnv and VirtualBuildEnv. Both are automatically generated as before but only VirtualBuildEnv will be activated by default. (conan-io/conan#9161). Docs: 📃
Bugfix: Fixing workspace install when conanfile has imports(). (conan-io/conan#9281)
Bugfix: Fix QbsProfile toolchain qbs.architecture KeyError. (conan-io/conan#9192)
Bugfix: Do not define CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET  in CMakeToolchain for Ninja generator, and define it in vcvars_ver instead. (conan-io/conan#9187)
BugFix: build_requires in host context, like gtest, are being propagated downstream by generators in the dependencies model. (conan-io/conan#9171). Docs: 📃
Bugfix: Fix that overridden requirements ""cannot be found in lockfile"". (conan-io/conan#8907)

1.38.0 (30-Jun-2021)

Feature: New PkgConfigDeps generator. (conan-io/conan#9152). Docs: 📃
Feature: Proposal of jinja2 templates for profiles. (conan-io/conan#9147). Docs: 📃
Feature: Add support for CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED in CMakeToolchain. (conan-io/conan#9144)
Feature: Add context information to conan info output both to stdout and json outputs. (conan-io/conan#9137). Docs: 📃
Feature: Improved the new AutotoolsToolchain, AutotoolsDeps and Autotools build helper. (conan-io/conan#9131). Docs: 📃
Feature: Initial cross-build support in CMakeToolchain with definition of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME, CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR and CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION, deduced from self.settings_build (only using the 2 profiles) and from new [conf] items. (conan-io/conan#9115). Docs: 📃
Feature: Easier access to modify or update context values in CMakeToolchain blocks. (conan-io/conan#9109). Docs: 📃
Feature: Provide [conf] command line support. (conan-io/conan#9103). Docs: 📃
Feature: Added support for using server config from a custom location, setting CONAN_SERVER_HOME env variable or using -d or --server_dir flag when launching the server with conan_server command. (conan-io/conan#9099). Docs: 📃
Feature: Support for CMakeDeps generator of a new property ""skip_deps_file"" to be declared in the cpp_info of a package to skip creating xxx-config.cmake files for it, allowing to create ""system wrapper"" recipes easily. (conan-io/conan#9087). Docs: 📃
Feature: New conanfile.dependencies model, using a dict {requirement: ConanFileInterface} to prepare for Conan 2.0. (conan-io/conan#9062). Docs: 📃
Feature: Allow a explicit requires = ""pkg..#recipe_revision"" to update cache revision without --update. (conan-io/conan#9058). Docs: 📃
Feature: New cmake_layout() layout helper to define a multi-platform CMake layout that will work for different generators (ninja, xcode, visual, unix), and is multi-config. (conan-io/conan#9057). Docs: 📃
Feature: The conan_toolchain.cmake now includes xxx_DIR variables for the dependencies to ease the find_package mechanism to locate them. The declaration of these directories is a must when cross-building in OSX where CMake ignores CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH and CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to look only at the system framework directories. (conan-io/conan#9032). Docs: 📃
Feature: Provide access in the recipes to the environment declared with the new environment system. (conan-io/conan#9030). Docs: 📃
Fix: Fix Bazel build string defines. (conan-io/conan#9139)
Fix: Fixed behavior in the self.folders feature whereby the sources saved or downloaded inside the source(self) were saved at the self.folders.source folder. But self.folders.source is intended to describe where the sources are instead of forcing where the sources are saved. (conan-io/conan#9124). Docs: 📃

Release notes
Sourced from conan's releases.

1.39.0 (27-Jul-2021)

Feature: Use CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to get -version-min set in CMakeToolchain. (conan-io/conan#9301)
Feature: Display python_requires information in the conan info output. (conan-io/conan#9290)
Feature: Now it is possible to define settings for a downstream consumer using -s &:setting=value or the same syntax in the profile even if the consumer is a conanfile.txt or a conanfile.py not declaring a name. e.g: Building a Debug application with Release dependencies: -s build_type=Release -s &:build_type=Debug (conan-io/conan#9267). Docs: 📃
Feature: The AutotoolsDeps allows to alter the generated environment corresponding to the information read from the dependencies before calling the generate() method. (conan-io/conan#9256). Docs: 📃
Feature: new remove and items methods for the Environment objects. (conan-io/conan#9256). Docs: 📃
Feature: New VCVars generator that generates a conanvcvars.bat that activates the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt. (conan-io/conan#9230). Docs: 📃
Feature: Skip build helper test and using [conf]. (conan-io/conan#9218). Docs: 📃
Feature: Implement a new requires = ""pkg/(alias)"" syntax to be able to dissambiguate alias requirements and resolve them earlier in the flow, solving some limitations of the previous alias definition. This approach is intended to be the one in Conan 2.0 (issue backported from conan-io/tribe#25). (conan-io/conan#9217). Docs: 📃
Feature: Introduce the -require-override argument to define dependency overrides directly on command line. (conan-io/conan#9195). Docs: 📃
Feature: New self.win_bash mechanism to enable running commands in a bash shell in Windows. It works only with the new environment definition from the dependencies (env_buildinfo and run_buildinfo) as long as the new AutotoolsToolchain, AutotoolsDeps and Autotools build helper. It supports automatic conversion of the environment variables values declared as ""path"" according to the declared subsystem in the conf tools.win.bash:subsystem, that is not being auto-detected anymore. (conan-io/conan#9194). Docs: 📃
Feature: A unique environment launcher (conanenv.bat/sh) is generated to aggregate all the environment generators (VirtualRunEnv, VirtualBuildEnv, AutotoolsToolchain and AutotoolsDeps) that had been generated so the user can easily activate all of them with one command. (conan-io/conan#9161). Docs: 📃
Feature: Use CMake File API. (conan-io/conan#9005)
Fix: Add bindirs definition to cmake_layout(). (conan-io/conan#9276)
Fix: Improve error message when conan search <ref> a package in editable mode. (conan-io/conan#9262)
Fix: Add options to conanfile.dependencies model. (conan-io/conan#9258)
Fix: Fix CMake rejecting library name with special characters. (conan-io/conan#9245)
Fix: Use filename [PKG-NAME]-[COMP-NAME] for PkgConfigDeps. (conan-io/conan#9228). Docs: 📃
Fix: Saving all the toolchain args information into conanbuild.conf instead of json file. (conan-io/conan#9225). Docs: 📃
Fix: Added warning in the new toolchains (the used in the generate() method) if no build profile is being used. (conan-io/conan#9206). Docs: 📃
Fix: Implemented check that will raise an error in the CMakeDeps generator when using the build_context_activated, build_context_suffix or build_context_build_modules attributes if no build profile is being used. (conan-io/conan#9206). Docs: 📃
Fix: TheCMakeDeps generator will check if the targets specified in the find_package(foo components x y z) exist instead of checking against an internal variable. Also, this check will be done at the end of the xxx-config.cmake so any included build_module can declare the needed targets. (conan-io/conan#9206). Docs: 📃
Fix: Consistent help message for conan profile (sub-command part). (conan-io/conan#9204). Docs: 📃
Fix: Consistently put short arguments (-a) before long ones (--args). (conan-io/conan#9199)
Fix: CC=clang --gcc-toolchain is now identified as clang. (conan-io/conan#9198)
Fix: The new VirtualEnv generator has been split into VirtualRunEnv and VirtualBuildEnv. Both are automatically generated as before but only VirtualBuildEnv will be activated by default. (conan-io/conan#9161). Docs: 📃
Bugfix: Fixing workspace install when conanfile has imports(). (conan-io/conan#9281)
Bugfix: Fix QbsProfile toolchain qbs.architecture KeyError. (conan-io/conan#9192)
Bugfix: Do not define CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET  in CMakeToolchain for Ninja generator, and define it in vcvars_ver instead. (conan-io/conan#9187)
BugFix: build_requires in host context, like gtest, are being propagated downstream by generators in the dependencies model. (conan-io/conan#9171). Docs: 📃
Bugfix: Fix that overridden requirements ""cannot be found in lockfile"". (conan-io/conan#8907)

1.38.0 (30-Jun-2021)

Feature: New PkgConfigDeps generator. (conan-io/conan#9152). Docs: 📃
Feature: Proposal of jinja2 templates for profiles. (conan-io/conan#9147). Docs: 📃
Feature: Add support for CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED in CMakeToolchain. (conan-io/conan#9144)
Feature: Add context information to conan info output both to stdout and json outputs. (conan-io/conan#9137). Docs: 📃
Feature: Improved the new AutotoolsToolchain, AutotoolsDeps and Autotools build helper. (conan-io/conan#9131). Docs: 📃
Feature: Initial cross-build support in CMakeToolchain with definition of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME, CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR and CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION, deduced from self.settings_build (only using the 2 profiles) and from new [conf] items. (conan-io/conan#9115). Docs: 📃
Feature: Easier access to modify or update context values in CMakeToolchain blocks. (conan-io/conan#9109). Docs: 📃
Feature: Provide [conf] command line support. (conan-io/conan#9103). Docs: 📃
Feature: Added support for using server config from a custom location, setting CONAN_SERVER_HOME env variable or using -d or --server_dir flag when launching the server with conan_server command. (conan-io/conan#9099). Docs: 📃
Feature: Support for CMakeDeps generator of a new property ""skip_deps_file"" to be declared in the cpp_info of a package to skip creating xxx-config.cmake files for it, allowing to create ""system wrapper"" recipes easily. (conan-io/conan#9087). Docs: 📃
Feature: New conanfile.dependencies model, using a dict {requirement: ConanFileInterface} to prepare for Conan 2.0. (conan-io/conan#9062). Docs: 📃
Feature: Allow a explicit requires = ""pkg..#recipe_revision"" to update cache revision without --update. (conan-io/conan#9058). Docs: 📃
Feature: New cmake_layout() layout helper to define a multi-platform CMake layout that will work for different generators (ninja, xcode, visual, unix), and is multi-config. (conan-io/conan#9057). Docs: 📃
Feature: The conan_toolchain.cmake now includes xxx_DIR variables for the dependencies to ease the find_package mechanism to locate them. The declaration of these directories is a must when cross-building in OSX where CMake ignores CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH and CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to look only at the system framework directories. (conan-io/conan#9032). Docs: 📃
Feature: Provide access in the recipes to the environment declared with the new environment system. (conan-io/conan#9030). Docs: 📃
Fix: Fix Bazel build string defines. (conan-io/conan#9139)
Fix: Fixed behavior in the self.folders feature whereby the sources saved or downloaded inside the source(self) were saved at the self.folders.source folder. But self.folders.source is intended to describe where the sources are instead of forcing where the sources are saved. (conan-io/conan#9124). Docs: 📃

Feature: CMakeDeps. Added a new property cmake_find_mode with possible values to config(default), module, both or none to control the files to be generated from a package itself. The none replaces the current skip_deps_file property. (conan-io/conan#9455). Docs: 📃
Feature: CMakeDeps: Added two new properties cmake_module_file_name and cmake_module_target_name, analog to cmake_file_name and cmake_target_name, but to configure the name of FindXXX.cmake file and the target declared inside. (conan-io/conan#9455). Docs: 📃
Feature: Remove conan-center (https://conan.bintray.com) default remote. (conan-io/conan#9401). Docs: 📃

Fix:  Relax python six dependency to allow 1.16 (conan-io/conan#9407)
Fix: Bump urllib3 version to 1.26.6 (conan-io/conan#9405)
Fix: The new Autotools build helper accepts a build_script_folder  argument in the configure() method to specify are subfolder where the configure script is. (conan-io/conan#9393). Docs: 📃
Fix: Use frameworks in Premake generator. (conan-io/conan#9371). Docs: 📃
Fix: The tool conan.tools.files.apply_conandata_patches will use the root source folder to find the patch file and the tool conan.tools.files.patch will take the current source folder declared in the layout() method to know where is the source to apply the patches. (conan-io/conan#9361). Docs: 📃
Fix: Avoid checking other remotes when -r=remote is defined and revisions are activated and binary is not found in the defined remote. (conan-io/conan#9355)
Bugfix: Setting the CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET variable as a cache entry. (conan-io/conan#9498)
BugFix: Use topological ordering to define VirtualBuildEnv composition and precedence of appending variables. (conan-io/conan#9491)
Bugfix: Bazel build files have an extra ] if there are no dependencies. (conan-io/conan#9480)
Bugfix: Add AlmaLinux to with_yum. (conan-io/conan#9463)
Bugfix: CMakeToolchain. Fixed a bugfix whereby a variable declared at the .variables containing a boolean ended at CMake with a quoted ""True"" or ""False"" values, instead of ON / OFF (conan-io/conan#9455). Docs: 📃
Bugfix: Fixed bug whereby Conan failed when using compiler=gcc with compiler.version=5 (without specifying a minor version) and compiler.cppstd=17. (conan-io/conan#9431)
Bugfix: No verbose traceback was been printed for conanfile.layout() method. (conan-io/conan#9384)

Bugfix: Fix PkgConfigDeps that was failing in the case of components with requirements. (conan-io/conan#9341)

1.39.0 (27-Jul-2021)

Feature: Use CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to get -version-min set in CMakeToolchain. (conan-io/conan#9301)
Feature: Display python_requires information in the conan info output. (conan-io/conan#9290)
Feature: Now it is possible to define settings for a downstream consumer using -s &:setting=value or the same syntax in the profile even if the consumer is a conanfile.txt or a conanfile.py not declaring a name. e.g: Building a Debug application with Release dependencies: -s build_type=Release -s &:build_type=Debug (conan-io/conan#9267). Docs: 📃
Feature: The AutotoolsDeps allows to alter the generated environment corresponding to the information read from the dependencies before calling the generate() method. (conan-io/conan#9256). Docs: 📃
Feature: new remove and items methods for the Environment objects. (conan-io/conan#9256). Docs: 📃
Feature: New VCVars generator that generates a conanvcvars.bat that activates the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt. (conan-io/conan#9230). Docs: 📃
Feature: Skip build helper test and using [conf]. (conan-io/conan#9218). Docs: 📃
Feature: Implement a new requires = ""pkg/(alias)"" syntax to be able to dissambiguate alias requirements and resolve them earlier in the flow, solving some limitations of the previous alias definition. This approach is intended to be the one in Conan 2.0 (issue backported from conan-io/tribe#25). (conan-io/conan#9217). Docs: 📃
Feature: Introduce the -require-override argument to define dependency overrides directly on command line. (conan-io/conan#9195). Docs: 📃
Feature: New self.win_bash mechanism to enable running commands in a bash shell in Windows. It works only with the new environment definition from the dependencies (env_buildinfo and run_buildinfo) as long as the new AutotoolsToolchain, AutotoolsDeps and Autotools build helper. It supports automatic conversion of the environment variables values declared as ""path"" according to the declared subsystem in the conf tools.win.bash:subsystem, that is not being auto-detected anymore. (conan-io/conan#9194). Docs: 📃
Feature: A unique environment launcher (conanenv.bat/sh) is generated to aggregate all the environment generators (VirtualRunEnv, VirtualBuildEnv, AutotoolsToolchain and AutotoolsDeps) that had been generated so the user can easily activate all of them with one command.

Feature: Skip build helper test and using [conf]. (conan-io/conan#9218). Docs: 📃
Feature: Implement a new requires = ""pkg/(alias)"" syntax to be able to dissambiguate alias requirements and resolve them earlier in the flow, solving some limitations of the previous alias definition. This approach is intended to be the one in Conan 2.0 (issue backported from conan-io/tribe#25). (conan-io/conan#9217). Docs: 📃
Feature: Introduce the -require-override argument to define dependency overrides directly on command line. (conan-io/conan#9195). Docs: 📃
Feature: New self.win_bash mechanism to enable running commands in a bash shell in Windows. It works only with the new environment definition from the dependencies (env_buildinfo and run_buildinfo) as long as the new AutotoolsToolchain, AutotoolsDeps and Autotools build helper. It supports automatic conversion of the environment variables values declared as ""path"" according to the declared subsystem in the conf tools.win.bash:subsystem, that is not being auto-detected anymore. (conan-io/conan#9194). Docs: 📃
Feature: A unique environment launcher (conanenv.bat/sh) is generated to aggregate all the environment generators (VirtualRunEnv, VirtualBuildEnv, AutotoolsToolchain and AutotoolsDeps) that had been generated so the user can easily activate all of them with one command. (conan-io/conan#9161). Docs: 📃
Feature: Use CMake File API. (conan-io/conan#9005)
Fix: Add bindirs definition to cmake_layout(). (conan-io/conan#9276)

Release notes
Sourced from conan's releases.

1.42.0 (29-Oct-2021)

Feature: Remove sdk condition in .xcconfig files generated by XcodeDeps. (conan-io/conan#9887)
Feature: Add new Macos version 12.0 (Monterey). (conan-io/conan#9886)
Feature: Add CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE in CMakeToolchain if it's set in the conanfile independently from the value of the shared option. (conan-io/conan#9868)
Feature: Generate aggregated deactivation file for aggregated environments. (conan-io/conan#9862). Docs: 📃
Feature: adding preprocessor definitions to MSBuildTolchain ResourceCompile. (conan-io/conan#9843)
Feature: Support cmake_module_target_name and cmake_module_file_name properties in cmake_find_package generator. (conan-io/conan#9832). Docs: 📃
Feature: Define new conf[""tools.microsoft.msbuild:install_path""] for the MSBuild toolchain and remove generation of intel_vars files by VCVars. (conan-io/conan#9827). Docs: 📃
Feature: New Conan XcodeDeps multi-config generator for Xcode. (conan-io/conan#9807). Docs: 📃
Feature: Refactor conan.tools.gnu.pkgconfigdeps module. (conan-io/conan#9806)
Feature: Decoupled Environment as an abstract environment representation (do not depend on conanfile), and EnvVars, as the specialization for a given conanfile, settings/settings_build, and win_bash. (conan-io/conan#9755). Docs: 📃
Feature: Enabled patch_string when using apply_conandata_patches. (conan-io/conan#9740). Docs: 📃
Feature: Add property ""cmake_target_aliases"" to create some CMake alias targets using CMakeDeps. (conan-io/conan#8533)
Fix: Do not fall back for the property ""filename"" to target properties, only to legacy ""names"" definition. (conan-io/conan#9894)
Fix: Fix build settings conditional logic to work correctly with Xcode IDE. (conan-io/conan#9892)
Fix: Show a more specific error message on 'conan search' when a package version is not valid (conan-io/conan#9891)
Fix: Removed the new layout folders.package property as it was not clear the value/usage. (conan-io/conan#9884). Docs: 📃
Fix: The ""conan package"" method now raises an exception when declaring the layout() method. This is part of the migration to Conan 2.0 where the local method ""conan package"" is removed. (conan-io/conan#9884). Docs: 📃
Fix: Moved experimental LayoutPackager to a conan.tools.files.AutoPackager with a new interface. Removed also the conanfile.patterns attribute that now is configured directly in the AutoPackager. (conan-io/conan#9882). Docs: 📃
Fix: When the layout() method is declared inside the conanfile.py of a test-package, Conan won't generate temporary folders at build/HASH anymore. The build folder will follow the structure declared at the layout() method. (conan-io/conan#9882). Docs: 📃
Fix: Fix frameworks aggregation in XcodeDeps. (conan-io/conan#9881)
Fix: Remove python requests version from User-Agent header, it can be problematic sometimes and adds no value. (conan-io/conan#9861)
Fix: Change MesonToolchain to define preprocessor_definitions as [constant], because Meson 0.60 now raises errors on it defined in [built-in options]. (conan-io/conan#9858)
Fix: Rename ConanFileInterface.new_cpp_info to ConanFileInterface.cpp_info (being it a NewCppInfo object). The ConanFileInterface object is only used when accessing self.dependencies in a conanfile, so we can make sure that the new develop generators use the final cpp_info name. (conan-io/conan#9800). Docs: 📃
Fix: Renamed group argument in Environment classes to scope, that can get ""build"" and ""run"" values. (conan-io/conan#9755). Docs: 📃
Fix: New win_bash behavior failed for dual profile, the new computation of subsystem paths completely depend now on defined settings, but not on platform.system() or auto-detection. (conan-io/conan#9755). Docs: 📃
Bugfix: Avoid lockfile raising because of incorrect options when using compatible_packages. Close conan-io/conan#9591 (conan-io/conan#9890)
Bugfix: Avoid VCVars defining -vcvars argument for VS<=2015. Close conan-io/conan#9888 (conan-io/conan#9889)
Bugfix: Respect the previous value of sys.dont_write_bytecode. (conan-io/conan#9865)
Bugfix: conan export-pkg now raises an error (ConanInvalidConfiguration exception) if the validate() method raise that error and results in an invalid package_id. (conan-io/conan#9818)
Bugfix: Respect the build_policy=""never"" even for --build=missing cli argument. (conan-io/conan#9817)
Bugfix: Avoid crash in CMakeToolchain for custom generator when compiler is not defined. (conan-io/conan#9801)
Bugfix: Do not force new authentication when a token is expired, it might not be needed. (conan-io/conan#9781)
Bugfix: The CMakeToolchain generator always sets fPIC enabled due to a typo where the actual parameter is not templated but instead hard-coded as ON. (conan-io/conan#9752)
Bugfix: The path to a patch file in a conandata.yml is also relative to the base source folder when the patches are not associated with a version (list of patches). (conan-io/conan#9740). Docs: 📃

Release notes
Sourced from rusqlite's releases.

rusqlite v0.25.2 (yanked) / libsqlite3-sys v0.22.2
Note: rusqlite v0.25.2 has been yanked because it accidentally enabled bundled-full as a default feature. v0.25.3 has been cut that is equivalent but without that change. The libsqlite3-sys release that happened at the same time is still fine.
This release is a patch release that enables builds on some older versions of Rust. Rusqlite does not commit to a particular MSRV, but this release is known to work at least back to Rust 1.41.0.
It is likely that the next release will require a newer version of Rust, whether or not it is mentioned in the release notes.
rusqlite 0.25.1, libsqlite3-sys 0.22.1

Use SQLITE_TEMP_STORE=3 on android. (#937)
Upgrade to bindgen 0.58 (#933)

rusqlite 0.24.1, libsqlite3-sys 0.20.1


The lru-cache crate has been replaced with hashlink, which may fix panics on Rust nightly caused by unsoundness in some versions of the lru-cache crate (#811).


A positional BLOB I/O API has been added, which more closely mirrors SQLites actual BLOB I/O api, and is similar to unix-style pwrite/pread. (#780).


A winsqlite3 feature as been added to both rusqlite and libsqlite3-sys which allows linking against the SQLite present in newer versions of Windows 10 (#796).


Rusqlite's iterator types are now #[must_use] (#799).


Several dependencies have been updated.


rusqlite 0.24.0, libsqlite-sys 0.20.0

BREAKING CHANGE: Upgrade to time v0.2 and put it behind a feature flag (#653)
impl TryFrom<&Row<'_>> for (...)
This change implements TryFrom<&Row> for tuples up to 16 fields. This
is a convenience function that can be used to map rows more easily.
adding ability to work with sqlite compiled with SQLITE_OMIT_DECLTYPE (feature column_decltype)
LIBSQLITE3_FLAGS hook
Enables compiling bundled sources with different flags.
Add cross-compilation with mingw (#774)
Support wasm32-wasi target (#785)
Implement our own sqlite3_execwhich supports unlock notify (#767)
Fix order of parameters in InvalidParameterCount message (#779)
Don't implement Into for Statement (#763)
Publically expose Map
little speedup for bundled sqlite3.c on unix (HAVE_LOCALTIME_R)
BREAKING CHANGE: VTabCursor lifetime should be bound to VTab lifetime (#753)
preupdate_hook feature requires buildtime_bindgen
Upgrade SQLite bundled sources to 3.33.0
Upgrade to bindgen 0.54
Fix missing docs
Add link to gitter channel (#738)
Include LICENSE into the libsqlite3-sys crate (#736)

rusqlite 0.23.0, libsqlite-sys 0.18.0
The release primarily contains a number of security/memory safety fixes, which were mostly found due to an audit of the unsafe code in the crate. An advisory will be published for these shortly.
They mostly impact APIs exposed through features, so while there are a lot of them, if you're using rusqlite under default features, you're fine. None of them impact libsqlite3-sys.

Release notes
Sourced from rusqlite's releases.

rusqlite v0.25.2 (yanked) / libsqlite3-sys v0.22.2
Note: rusqlite v0.25.2 has been yanked because it accidentally enabled bundled-full as a default feature. v0.25.3 has been cut that is equivalent but without that change. The libsqlite3-sys release that happened at the same time is still fine.
This release is a patch release that enables builds on some older versions of Rust. Rusqlite does not commit to a particular MSRV, but this release is known to work at least back to Rust 1.41.0.
It is likely that the next release will require a newer version of Rust, whether or not it is mentioned in the release notes.
rusqlite 0.25.1, libsqlite3-sys 0.22.1

Use SQLITE_TEMP_STORE=3 on android. (#937)
Upgrade to bindgen 0.58 (#933)

rusqlite 0.24.1, libsqlite3-sys 0.20.1


The lru-cache crate has been replaced with hashlink, which may fix panics on Rust nightly caused by unsoundness in some versions of the lru-cache crate (#811).


A positional BLOB I/O API has been added, which more closely mirrors SQLites actual BLOB I/O api, and is similar to unix-style pwrite/pread. (#780).


A winsqlite3 feature as been added to both rusqlite and libsqlite3-sys which allows linking against the SQLite present in newer versions of Windows 10 (#796).


Rusqlite's iterator types are now #[must_use] (#799).


Several dependencies have been updated.


rusqlite 0.24.0, libsqlite-sys 0.20.0

BREAKING CHANGE: Upgrade to time v0.2 and put it behind a feature flag (#653)
impl TryFrom<&Row<'_>> for (...)
This change implements TryFrom<&Row> for tuples up to 16 fields. This
is a convenience function that can be used to map rows more easily.
adding ability to work with sqlite compiled with SQLITE_OMIT_DECLTYPE (feature column_decltype)
LIBSQLITE3_FLAGS hook
Enables compiling bundled sources with different flags.
Add cross-compilation with mingw (#774)
Support wasm32-wasi target (#785)
Implement our own sqlite3_execwhich supports unlock notify (#767)
Fix order of parameters in InvalidParameterCount message (#779)
Don't implement Into for Statement (#763)
Publically expose Map
little speedup for bundled sqlite3.c on unix (HAVE_LOCALTIME_R)
BREAKING CHANGE: VTabCursor lifetime should be bound to VTab lifetime (#753)
preupdate_hook feature requires buildtime_bindgen
Upgrade SQLite bundled sources to 3.33.0
Upgrade to bindgen 0.54
Fix missing docs
Add link to gitter channel (#738)
Include LICENSE into the libsqlite3-sys crate (#736)

rusqlite 0.23.0, libsqlite-sys 0.18.0
The release primarily contains a number of security/memory safety fixes, which were mostly found due to an audit of the unsafe code in the crate. An advisory will be published for these shortly.
They mostly impact APIs exposed through features, so while there are a lot of them, if you're using rusqlite under default features, you're fine. None of them impact libsqlite3-sys.

Release notes
Sourced from conan's releases.

1.44.0 (29-Dec-2021)

Feature: Add <PackageName>_LIBRARIES, <PackageName>_INCLUDE_DIRS, <PackageName>_INCLUDE_DIR, <PackageName>_DEFINITIONS and <PackageName>_VERSION_STRING variables in CMakeDeps. (conan-io/conan#10227)
Feature: Adding a new Block to the CMakeToolchain now doesn't require inheriting CMakeToolchainBlock. (conan-io/conan#10213). Docs: 📃
Feature: Add build_modules and build_modules_paths to JsonGenerator. (conan-io/conan#10203). Docs: 📃
Feature: The CMakeToolchain is now prepared to apply several user toolchains. (conan-io/conan#10178). Docs: 📃
Feature: In the conanfile.py of the test_package, the reference being tested is always available at self.tested_reference_str. (conan-io/conan#10171). Docs: 📃
Feature: Introduced a new test_type value explicit so a user can declare explicitly the requires or build_requires manually (using self.tested_reference_str), it won't be automatically injected as a require. In Conan 2.0 the test_type attribute will be ignored, the behavior will be always explicit, so declaring test_type=""explicit"" will make the test recipe compatible with Conan 2.0. (conan-io/conan#10171). Docs: 📃
Feature: Introduced tool_requires attribute to provide a compatible way to migrate to Conan 2.0, where the current concept of build_requires has been renamed to tool_requires. (conan-io/conan#10168). Docs: 📃
Feature: Upgrade Conan python jinja requirement to v3.x. (conan-io/conan#10159)
Feature: Provided several conan.tools.files functions to manage symlinks: Transform absolute to relative symlinks, remove broken symlinks, remove external symlinks and get the symlinks in a folder. These tools will help migrate to Conan 2.0 where the package files won't be automatically cleaned from broken absolute symlinks or external symlinks. (conan-io/conan#10154). Docs: 📃
Feature: Remove legacy folder setters in conanfile.xxxx_folder = yyy only used for testing. (conan-io/conan#10153)
Feature: Add Git.version property to check the current git version, aligned with SVN.version. (conan-io/conan#10114). Docs: 📃
Feature: Add build_requires support in BazelDeps generators. (conan-io/conan#9876)
Fix: Fix variable names set by CMakeDeps modules. (conan-io/conan#10227)
Fix: Call to find_dependency in module mode to find transitive dependencies. (conan-io/conan#10227)
Fix: remove rpath from .pc files generated by pkg_config & PkgConfigDeps generators. (conan-io/conan#10192). Docs: 📃
Fix: Deleted CMake warning for already existing targets. (conan-io/conan#10150)
Bugfix: Fix passing component's linkflags in CMakeDepes generator (conan-io/conan#10205)
Bugfix: AutotoolsToolchain was not passing the compiler to get_gnu_triplet function. (conan-io/conan#10141)

Release notes
Sourced from conan's releases.

1.44.0 (29-Dec-2021)

Feature: Add <PackageName>_LIBRARIES, <PackageName>_INCLUDE_DIRS, <PackageName>_INCLUDE_DIR, <PackageName>_DEFINITIONS and <PackageName>_VERSION_STRING variables in CMakeDeps. (conan-io/conan#10227)
Feature: Adding a new Block to the CMakeToolchain now doesn't require inheriting CMakeToolchainBlock. (conan-io/conan#10213). Docs: 📃
Feature: Add build_modules and build_modules_paths to JsonGenerator. (conan-io/conan#10203). Docs: 📃
Feature: The CMakeToolchain is now prepared to apply several user toolchains. (conan-io/conan#10178). Docs: 📃
Feature: In the conanfile.py of the test_package, the reference being tested is always available at self.tested_reference_str. (conan-io/conan#10171). Docs: 📃
Feature: Introduced a new test_type value explicit so a user can declare explicitly the requires or build_requires manually (using self.tested_reference_str), it won't be automatically injected as a require. In Conan 2.0 the test_type attribute will be ignored, the behavior will be always explicit, so declaring test_type=""explicit"" will make the test recipe compatible with Conan 2.0. (conan-io/conan#10171). Docs: 📃
Feature: Introduced tool_requires attribute to provide a compatible way to migrate to Conan 2.0, where the current concept of build_requires has been renamed to tool_requires. (conan-io/conan#10168). Docs: 📃
Feature: Upgrade Conan python jinja requirement to v3.x. (conan-io/conan#10159)
Feature: Provided several conan.tools.files functions to manage symlinks: Transform absolute to relative symlinks, remove broken symlinks, remove external symlinks and get the symlinks in a folder. These tools will help migrate to Conan 2.0 where the package files won't be automatically cleaned from broken absolute symlinks or external symlinks. (conan-io/conan#10154). Docs: 📃
Feature: Remove legacy folder setters in conanfile.xxxx_folder = yyy only used for testing. (conan-io/conan#10153)
Feature: Add Git.version property to check the current git version, aligned with SVN.version. (conan-io/conan#10114). Docs: 📃
Feature: Add build_requires support in BazelDeps generators. (conan-io/conan#9876)
Fix: Fix variable names set by CMakeDeps modules. (conan-io/conan#10227)
Fix: Call to find_dependency in module mode to find transitive dependencies. (conan-io/conan#10227)
Fix: remove rpath from .pc files generated by pkg_config & PkgConfigDeps generators. (conan-io/conan#10192). Docs: 📃
Fix: Deleted CMake warning for already existing targets. (conan-io/conan#10150)
Bugfix: Fix passing component's linkflags in CMakeDepes generator (conan-io/conan#10205)
Bugfix: AutotoolsToolchain was not passing the compiler to get_gnu_triplet function. (conan-io/conan#10141)

Release notes
Sourced from clap's releases.

v3.0.0
Note: clap v3 has been in development for several years and has changed
hands multiple times.  Unfortunately, our changelog might be incomplete,
whether in changes or their motivation.
Highlights
A special thanks to the maintainers, contributors, beta users, and sponsors who
have helped along this journey, especially kbknapp.
StructOpt Integration
StructOpt provides a serde-like declarative
approach to defining your parser.  The main benefits we've seen so far from integrating are:

Tighter feedback between the design of clap and the derives
More universal traits.  Crates exist for common CLI patterns
(example)
and we've re-designed the StructOpt traits so crates built on clap3 can be
reused not just with other derives but also people using the builder API.
People can even hand implement these so people using the builder API won't
have the pay the cost for derives.

Custom Help Headings
Previously, clap automatically grouped arguments in the help as either
ARGS, FLAGS, OPTIONS, and SUBCOMMANDS.
You can now override the default group with Arg::help_heading and
App::subcommand_help_heading.  To apply a heading to a series of arguments,
you can set App::help_heading.
Deprecations
While a lot of deprecations have been added to clean up the API (overloaded
meaning of Arg::multiple) or make things more consistent, some particular
highlights are:

clap_app! has been deprecated in favor of the builder API with arg! (clap-rs/clap#2835)
Arg::from_usage has been deprecated in favor of arg! (clap-rs/clap#3087)

Porting example


The YAML API has been deprecated in favor the builder or derive APIs (clap-rs/clap#3087)

Migrating
From clap v2

Add CLI tests, -h and --help output at a minimum (recommendation: trycmd for snapshot testing)
Update your dependency

If you use no-default-features: add the std feature


Resolve compiler errors
Resolve behavior changes

Release notes
Sourced from clap's releases.

v3.0.1
[3.0.1] - 2022-01-03
Fixes

Don't panic when getting number of values (#3241)
Don't warn when using default_value_t derive attribute with a Subcommand (#3245)

Documentation

Added name attribute to ArgEnum variant derive reference

v3.0.0
Note: clap v3 has been in development for several years and has changed
hands multiple times.  Unfortunately, our changelog might be incomplete,
whether in changes or their motivation.
Highlights
A special thanks to the maintainers, contributors, beta users, and sponsors who
have helped along this journey, especially kbknapp.
StructOpt Integration
StructOpt provides a serde-like declarative
approach to defining your parser.  The main benefits we've seen so far from integrating are:

Tighter feedback between the design of clap and the derives
More universal traits.  Crates exist for common CLI patterns
(example)
and we've re-designed the StructOpt traits so crates built on clap3 can be
reused not just with other derives but also people using the builder API.
People can even hand implement these so people using the builder API won't
have the pay the cost for derives.

Custom Help Headings
Previously, clap automatically grouped arguments in the help as either
ARGS, FLAGS, OPTIONS, and SUBCOMMANDS.
You can now override the default group with Arg::help_heading and
App::subcommand_help_heading.  To apply a heading to a series of arguments,
you can set App::help_heading.
Deprecations
While a lot of deprecations have been added to clean up the API (overloaded
meaning of Arg::multiple) or make things more consistent, some particular
highlights are:

clap_app! has been deprecated in favor of the builder API with arg! (clap-rs/clap#2835)
Arg::from_usage has been deprecated in favor of arg! (clap-rs/clap#3087)

v3.0.4
[3.0.4] - 2022-01-04
Features

For very limited cases, like cargo, expose ArgMatches::is_valid_arg to avoid panicing on undefined arguments

v3.0.3
[3.0.3] - 2022-01-04
Fixes

Specify cause of debug assert failure

v3.0.2
[3.0.2] - 2022-01-04
Fixes

Ignore Last when checking hyphen values (see #3249 for details)
Help catch bugs with #[must_use]

v3.0.1
[3.0.1] - 2022-01-03
Fixes

Don't panic when getting number of values (#3241)
Don't warn when using default_value_t derive attribute with a Subcommand (#3245)

Documentation

Added name attribute to ArgEnum variant derive reference

v3.0.0
Note: clap v3 has been in development for several years and has changed
hands multiple times.  Unfortunately, our changelog might be incomplete,
whether in changes or their motivation.
Highlights
A special thanks to the maintainers, contributors, beta users, and sponsors who
have helped along this journey, especially kbknapp.
StructOpt Integration
StructOpt provides a serde-like declarative
approach to defining your parser.  The main benefits we've seen so far from integrating are:

Tighter feedback between the design of clap and the derives
More universal traits.  Crates exist for common CLI patterns
(example)

Changelog
Sourced from tempfile's changelog.

3.3.0
Features:

Replace rand with fastrand for a significantly smaller dependency tree. Cryptographic randomness
isn't necessary for temporary file names, and isn't all that helpful either.
Add limited WASI support.
Add a function to extract the inner data from a SpooledTempFile.

Bug Fixes:

Make it possible to persist unnamed temporary files on linux by removing the O_EXCL flag.
Fix redox minimum crate version.

Add time_refresh option to #[cached] to refresh TTLs on cache hits
Generate *_prime_cache functions for every #[cached] and #[once] function
to allow priming caches.

[0.26.1] / [cached_proc_macro[0.7.1]]
Added

Add sync_writes option to #[cached] macro to synchronize
concurrent function calls of duplicate arguments. For ex, if
a long running #[cached(sync_writes = true)] function is called

Added

Add #[once] macro for create a RwLock cache wrapping a single value
For all caches, add a function to get an immutable reference to their

can be saved and restored later.

Removed
[0.26.1] / [cached_proc_macro[0.7.1]]
Added

Add sync_writes option to #[cached] macro to synchronize
concurrent function calls of duplicate arguments. For ex, if
a long running #[cached(sync_writes = true)] function is called
several times concurrently, the actual function is only executed
once while all other calls block and return the newly cached value.

Changed
Removed
[0.26.0] / [cached_proc_macro[0.7.0]]
Added

Add #[once] macro for create a RwLock cache wrapping a single value
For all caches, add a function to get an immutable reference to their
contents. This makes it possible to manually dump a cache, so its contents
can be saved and restored later.

Release notes
Sourced from tokio's releases.

Tokio v1.16.0
Fixes a soundness bug in io::Take (#4428). The unsoundness is exposed when
leaking memory in the given AsyncRead implementation and then overwriting the
supplied buffer:
impl AsyncRead for Buggy {
    fn poll_read(
        self: Pin<&mut Self>,
        cx: &mut Context<'_>,
        buf: &mut ReadBuf<'_>
    ) -> Poll<Result<()>> {
      let new_buf = vec![0; 5].leak();
      *buf = ReadBuf::new(new_buf);
      buf.put_slice(b""hello"");
      Poll::Ready(Ok(()))
    }
}
Also, this release includes improvements to the multi-threaded scheduler that
can increase throughput by up to 20% in some cases (#4383).
Fixed

io: soundness don't expose uninitialized memory when using io::Take in edge case (#4428)
fs: ensure File::write results in a write syscall when the runtime shuts down (#4316)
process: drop pipe after child exits in wait_with_output (#4315)
rt: improve error message when spawning a thread fails (#4398)
rt: reduce false-positive thread wakups in the multi-threaded scheduler (#4383)
sync: don't inherit Send from parking_lot::*Guard (#4359)

Added

Release notes
Sourced from conan's releases.

1.48.0 (03-May-2022)

Feature: Do not recommend to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH in markdown generator any more as it is already set by the AutotoolsToolchain. (conan-io/conan#11120)
Feature: The cmake_layout declares folders.generators = ""build/generators"" that is common for different configurations, enabling CMakePresets.json to support different configurePresets and buildPresets for single-config and multi-config generators. (conan-io/conan#11117). Docs: 📃
Feature: The CMakeToolchain generator will create (if missing) a CMakeUserPresets.json if the CMakeLists.txt file is found in the root folder of the project. That file will include automatically the CMakePresets.json file contained at build/generators folder to allow CMake and IDEs to locate automatically the presets generated by Conan. (conan-io/conan#11117). Docs: 📃
Feature: The CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is not adjusted in the conan_toolchain.cmake anymore, the configuration is moved to the CMakePresets.json preparing Conan to support multiple ""single-config"" configurations in one CMakePresets.json file (conan-io/conan#11112). Docs: 📃
Feature: The CMakePresets.json (file generated when specified the CMakeToolchain generator) is appended with a new buildPresets after a conan install with a different build_type when using a multiconfiguration generator like Visual Studio. (conan-io/conan#11103). Docs: 📃
Feature: Removed PlatformToolset and added conantoolchain.props  from *.vcxproj file. (conan-io/conan#11101)
Feature: Append the folder where the Conan generators were installed to PKG_CONFIG_PATH in AutotoolsToolchain. (conan-io/conan#11063). Docs: 📃
Feature: Adding new tools.env.virtualenv:powershell conf to opt-in to generate and use powershell scripts instead of .bat ones. (conan-io/conan#11061). Docs: 📃
Feature: Added new configuration fields: tools.apple:enable_bitcode, tools.apple:enable_arc and tools.apple:enable_visibility. (conan-io/conan#10985). Docs: 📃
Feature: Added new mechanism to inject common Xcode flags in CMakeToolchain generator if enabled Bitcode, ARC, or Visibility configurations. (conan-io/conan#10985). Docs: 📃
Feature: New templates for autotools exe and lib. (conan-io/conan#10978). Docs: 📃
Feature: Change build_script_folder argument from the configure to the Autotools build helper constructor. (conan-io/conan#10978). Docs: 📃
Feature: Replaced add_definitions by add_compile_definitions in conan.tools.cmake.* package. (conan-io/conan#10974)
Feature: Added cxxflags, cflags, and ldflags attributes to MSBuildToolchain. (conan-io/conan#10972). Docs: 📃
Feature: Added mechanism to inject extra flags to MSBuildToolchain via [conf]. (conan-io/conan#10972). Docs: 📃
Fix: Allow Version(self.settings.compiler.version) to work for new tools.scm.Version``. (conan-io/conan#11119)
Fix: Make shared libraries build with Autotools relocatable in Macos by patching the install name (LC_ID_DYLIB) and setting to @rpath/libname.dylib. (conan-io/conan#11114). Docs: 📃
Fix: using CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE instead of presets to define variables that don't work in toolchains (conan-io/conan#11098)
Fix: Fix quote escaping for defines in pkg_config generator. (conan-io/conan#11073)
Fix: Fix quote escaping for defines in PkgConfigDeps generator. (conan-io/conan#11073)
Fix: Quote add_compile_definitions correctly in CMakeToolchain. (conan-io/conan#11057)
Fix: Escape quotes in definitions in CMakeToochain. (conan-io/conan#11057)
Fix: Renamed self.base_source_folder to self.export_source_folder. That variable was introduced to reference the folder where the export_sources are. Currently, they are copied to the source folder but might be changed in the future to avoid copying them, so self.export_source_folder will always point to the folder containing the exports_sources. (conan-io/conan#11055). Docs: 📃
Fix: Ensure correct order for libraries in AutotoolsDeps. (conan-io/conan#11054)
Fix: Escape quotes in XCodeDeps generator. (conan-io/conan#11039)
Fix: The CMakeDeps generator now set INTERFACE_LINK_DIRECTORIES necessary when using auto link '#pragma comment(lib, ""foo"")'  when the required library sets the property cmake_set_interface_link_directories. (conan-io/conan#10984). Docs: 📃
Fix: Renamed variables from the CMakeToolchain context in blocks to be all lowercase. e.g: CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES to cmake_osx_architectures. (conan-io/conan#10981)
Bugfix: Avoid BazelDeps to find a library when a directory with the same name exists. (conan-io/conan#11090)
Bugfix: The binaryDir field at CMakePresets.json is not set if the conanfile.build_folder is not available, avoiding a null value breaking the specification. (conan-io/conan#11088)
Bugfix: Fixed unziping while using tools.get or tools.unzip with the strip_root=True in a tgz file with hardlinks inside. (conan-io/conan#11074)
Bugfix: The method get_commit from the new conan.tools.scm.Git was capturing a wrong commit, for example, ignoring commits in subfolders when checking the parent folder. (conan-io/conan#11015)
Bugfix: The json generator was showing ""None"" in the version field of the dependencies when the layout() method was used. (conan-io/conan#10960)
Bugfix: The config default_python_requires_id_mode=unrelated_mode raised an error, it has been fixed. (conan-io/conan#10959)
Bugfix: The CMakeToolchain now declares CACHE BOOL variables when a bool is stored in a variable: toolchain.variables[""FOO""] = True. (conan-io/conan#10941)

1.47.0 (31-Mar-2022)

Feature: Renamed tools.build:cppflags to tools.build:defines and removed tools.build:ldflags (now it's the union between tools.build:sharedlinkflags and tools.build:exelinkflags in mostly all the cases). (conan-io/conan#10928). Docs: 📃
Feature: Adding cross-compilation for Android in MesonToolchain. (conan-io/conan#10908). Docs: 📃
Feature: Add extra flags via [conf] into XcodeToolchain. (conan-io/conan#10906). Docs: 📃
Feature: Preliminar support for CMakePresets.json. (conan-io/conan#10903). Docs: 📃
Feature: Added wrap_mode=nofallback project-option into MesonToolchain as default value. (conan-io/conan#10884)
Feature: Added basic rmdir tool at conan.tools.files. (conan-io/conan#10874). Docs: 📃
Feature: Backport of 2.0 compatibility() recipe method. (conan-io/conan#10868)
Feature: Add detection in meson toolchain for cross conditions and requirement of needs_exe_wrapper. Users may specify the exe wrapper in their meson.build now. (conan-io/conan#10846)
Feature: Allow tested_reference_str to be None. (conan-io/conan#10834)
Feature: New templates for the conan new command with bazel examples: bazel_exe and bazel_lib. (conan-io/conan#10812). Docs: 📃
Feature: Add some support for msvc compiler older versions. (conan-io/conan#10808)
Feature: Added mechanism to inject extra flags via [conf] into several toolchains like AutotoolsToolchain, MesonToolchain and CMakeToolchain. (conan-io/conan#10800). Docs: 📃
Feature: Support selecting the target to build for XcodeBuild helper. (conan-io/conan#10799). Docs: 📃

Release notes
Sourced from conan's releases.

1.48.0 (03-May-2022)

Feature: Do not recommend to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH in markdown generator any more as it is already set by the AutotoolsToolchain. (conan-io/conan#11120)
Feature: The cmake_layout declares folders.generators = ""build/generators"" that is common for different configurations, enabling CMakePresets.json to support different configurePresets and buildPresets for single-config and multi-config generators. (conan-io/conan#11117). Docs: 📃
Feature: The CMakeToolchain generator will create (if missing) a CMakeUserPresets.json if the CMakeLists.txt file is found in the root folder of the project. That file will include automatically the CMakePresets.json file contained at build/generators folder to allow CMake and IDEs to locate automatically the presets generated by Conan. (conan-io/conan#11117). Docs: 📃
Feature: The CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is not adjusted in the conan_toolchain.cmake anymore, the configuration is moved to the CMakePresets.json preparing Conan to support multiple ""single-config"" configurations in one CMakePresets.json file (conan-io/conan#11112). Docs: 📃
Feature: The CMakePresets.json (file generated when specified the CMakeToolchain generator) is appended with a new buildPresets after a conan install with a different build_type when using a multiconfiguration generator like Visual Studio. (conan-io/conan#11103). Docs: 📃
Feature: Removed PlatformToolset and added conantoolchain.props  from *.vcxproj file. (conan-io/conan#11101)
Feature: Append the folder where the Conan generators were installed to PKG_CONFIG_PATH in AutotoolsToolchain. (conan-io/conan#11063). Docs: 📃
Feature: Adding new tools.env.virtualenv:powershell conf to opt-in to generate and use powershell scripts instead of .bat ones. (conan-io/conan#11061). Docs: 📃
Feature: Added new configuration fields: tools.apple:enable_bitcode, tools.apple:enable_arc and tools.apple:enable_visibility. (conan-io/conan#10985). Docs: 📃
Feature: Added new mechanism to inject common Xcode flags in CMakeToolchain generator if enabled Bitcode, ARC, or Visibility configurations. (conan-io/conan#10985). Docs: 📃
Feature: New templates for autotools exe and lib. (conan-io/conan#10978). Docs: 📃
Feature: Change build_script_folder argument from the configure to the Autotools build helper constructor. (conan-io/conan#10978). Docs: 📃
Feature: Replaced add_definitions by add_compile_definitions in conan.tools.cmake.* package. (conan-io/conan#10974)
Feature: Added cxxflags, cflags, and ldflags attributes to MSBuildToolchain. (conan-io/conan#10972). Docs: 📃
Feature: Added mechanism to inject extra flags to MSBuildToolchain via [conf]. (conan-io/conan#10972). Docs: 📃
Fix: Allow Version(self.settings.compiler.version) to work for new tools.scm.Version``. (conan-io/conan#11119)
Fix: Make shared libraries build with Autotools relocatable in Macos by patching the install name (LC_ID_DYLIB) and setting to @rpath/libname.dylib. (conan-io/conan#11114). Docs: 📃
Fix: using CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE instead of presets to define variables that don't work in toolchains (conan-io/conan#11098)
Fix: Fix quote escaping for defines in pkg_config generator. (conan-io/conan#11073)
Fix: Fix quote escaping for defines in PkgConfigDeps generator. (conan-io/conan#11073)
Fix: Quote add_compile_definitions correctly in CMakeToolchain. (conan-io/conan#11057)
Fix: Escape quotes in definitions in CMakeToochain. (conan-io/conan#11057)
Fix: Renamed self.base_source_folder to self.export_source_folder. That variable was introduced to reference the folder where the export_sources are. Currently, they are copied to the source folder but might be changed in the future to avoid copying them, so self.export_source_folder will always point to the folder containing the exports_sources. (conan-io/conan#11055). Docs: 📃
Fix: Ensure correct order for libraries in AutotoolsDeps. (conan-io/conan#11054)
Fix: Escape quotes in XCodeDeps generator. (conan-io/conan#11039)
Fix: The CMakeDeps generator now set INTERFACE_LINK_DIRECTORIES necessary when using auto link '#pragma comment(lib, ""foo"")'  when the required library sets the property cmake_set_interface_link_directories. (conan-io/conan#10984). Docs: 📃
Fix: Renamed variables from the CMakeToolchain context in blocks to be all lowercase. e.g: CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES to cmake_osx_architectures. (conan-io/conan#10981)
Bugfix: Avoid BazelDeps to find a library when a directory with the same name exists. (conan-io/conan#11090)
Bugfix: The binaryDir field at CMakePresets.json is not set if the conanfile.build_folder is not available, avoiding a null value breaking the specification. (conan-io/conan#11088)
Bugfix: Fixed unziping while using tools.get or tools.unzip with the strip_root=True in a tgz file with hardlinks inside. (conan-io/conan#11074)
Bugfix: The method get_commit from the new conan.tools.scm.Git was capturing a wrong commit, for example, ignoring commits in subfolders when checking the parent folder. (conan-io/conan#11015)
Bugfix: The json generator was showing ""None"" in the version field of the dependencies when the layout() method was used. (conan-io/conan#10960)
Bugfix: The config default_python_requires_id_mode=unrelated_mode raised an error, it has been fixed. (conan-io/conan#10959)
Bugfix: The CMakeToolchain now declares CACHE BOOL variables when a bool is stored in a variable: toolchain.variables[""FOO""] = True. (conan-io/conan#10941)

1.47.0 (31-Mar-2022)

Feature: Renamed tools.build:cppflags to tools.build:defines and removed tools.build:ldflags (now it's the union between tools.build:sharedlinkflags and tools.build:exelinkflags in mostly all the cases). (conan-io/conan#10928). Docs: 📃
Feature: Adding cross-compilation for Android in MesonToolchain. (conan-io/conan#10908). Docs: 📃
Feature: Add extra flags via [conf] into XcodeToolchain. (conan-io/conan#10906). Docs: 📃
Feature: Preliminar support for CMakePresets.json. (conan-io/conan#10903). Docs: 📃
Feature: Added wrap_mode=nofallback project-option into MesonToolchain as default value. (conan-io/conan#10884)
Feature: Added basic rmdir tool at conan.tools.files. (conan-io/conan#10874). Docs: 📃
Feature: Backport of 2.0 compatibility() recipe method. (conan-io/conan#10868)
Feature: Add detection in meson toolchain for cross conditions and requirement of needs_exe_wrapper. Users may specify the exe wrapper in their meson.build now. (conan-io/conan#10846)
Feature: Allow tested_reference_str to be None. (conan-io/conan#10834)
Feature: New templates for the conan new command with bazel examples: bazel_exe and bazel_lib. (conan-io/conan#10812). Docs: 📃
Feature: Add some support for msvc compiler older versions. (conan-io/conan#10808)
Feature: Added mechanism to inject extra flags via [conf] into several toolchains like AutotoolsToolchain, MesonToolchain and CMakeToolchain. (conan-io/conan#10800). Docs: 📃
Feature: Support selecting the target to build for XcodeBuild helper. (conan-io/conan#10799). Docs: 📃

Release notes
Sourced from conan's releases.

1.48.1 (18-May-2022)

Fix: Add -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to markdown generator instructions for CMake single config. (conan-io/conan#11234)
Bugfix: Fix case where CMakeDeps assumes a module dependency when transitive dependencies do not define cmake_find_mode and fallback to a config one. (conan-io/conan#11240)
Bugfix: Fixed broken apple-clang 13.0 compatibility. (conan-io/conan#11231)

1.48.0 (03-May-2022)

Feature: Do not recommend to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH in markdown generator any more as it is already set by the AutotoolsToolchain. (conan-io/conan#11120)
Feature: The cmake_layout declares folders.generators = ""build/generators"" that is common for different configurations, enabling CMakePresets.json to support different configurePresets and buildPresets for single-config and multi-config generators. (conan-io/conan#11117). Docs: 📃
Feature: The CMakeToolchain generator will create (if missing) a CMakeUserPresets.json if the CMakeLists.txt file is found in the root folder of the project. That file will include automatically the CMakePresets.json file contained at build/generators folder to allow CMake and IDEs to locate automatically the presets generated by Conan. (conan-io/conan#11117). Docs: 📃
Feature: The CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is not adjusted in the conan_toolchain.cmake anymore, the configuration is moved to the CMakePresets.json preparing Conan to support multiple ""single-config"" configurations in one CMakePresets.json file (conan-io/conan#11112). Docs: 📃
Feature: The CMakePresets.json (file generated when specified the CMakeToolchain generator) is appended with a new buildPresets after a conan install with a different build_type when using a multiconfiguration generator like Visual Studio. (conan-io/conan#11103). Docs: 📃
Feature: Removed PlatformToolset and added conantoolchain.props  from *.vcxproj file. (conan-io/conan#11101)
Feature: Append the folder where the Conan generators were installed to PKG_CONFIG_PATH in AutotoolsToolchain. (conan-io/conan#11063). Docs: 📃
Feature: Adding new tools.env.virtualenv:powershell conf to opt-in to generate and use powershell scripts instead of .bat ones. (conan-io/conan#11061). Docs: 📃
Feature: Added new configuration fields: tools.apple:enable_bitcode, tools.apple:enable_arc and tools.apple:enable_visibility. (conan-io/conan#10985). Docs: 📃
Feature: Added new mechanism to inject common Xcode flags in CMakeToolchain generator if enabled Bitcode, ARC, or Visibility configurations. (conan-io/conan#10985). Docs: 📃
Feature: New templates for autotools exe and lib. (conan-io/conan#10978). Docs: 📃
Feature: Change build_script_folder argument from the configure to the Autotools build helper constructor. (conan-io/conan#10978). Docs: 📃
Feature: Replaced add_definitions by add_compile_definitions in conan.tools.cmake.* package. (conan-io/conan#10974)
Feature: Added cxxflags, cflags, and ldflags attributes to MSBuildToolchain. (conan-io/conan#10972). Docs: 📃
Feature: Added mechanism to inject extra flags to MSBuildToolchain via [conf]. (conan-io/conan#10972). Docs: 📃
Fix: Allow Version(self.settings.compiler.version) to work for new tools.scm.Version``. (conan-io/conan#11119)
Fix: Make shared libraries build with Autotools relocatable in Macos by patching the install name (LC_ID_DYLIB) and setting to @rpath/libname.dylib. (conan-io/conan#11114). Docs: 📃
Fix: using CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE instead of presets to define variables that don't work in toolchains (conan-io/conan#11098)
Fix: Fix quote escaping for defines in pkg_config generator. (conan-io/conan#11073)
Fix: Fix quote escaping for defines in PkgConfigDeps generator. (conan-io/conan#11073)
Fix: Quote add_compile_definitions correctly in CMakeToolchain. (conan-io/conan#11057)
Fix: Escape quotes in definitions in CMakeToochain. (conan-io/conan#11057)
Fix: Renamed self.base_source_folder to self.export_source_folder. That variable was introduced to reference the folder where the export_sources are. Currently, they are copied to the source folder but might be changed in the future to avoid copying them, so self.export_source_folder will always point to the folder containing the exports_sources. (conan-io/conan#11055). Docs: 📃
Fix: Ensure correct order for libraries in AutotoolsDeps. (conan-io/conan#11054)
Fix: Escape quotes in XCodeDeps generator. (conan-io/conan#11039)
Fix: The CMakeDeps generator now set INTERFACE_LINK_DIRECTORIES necessary when using auto link '#pragma comment(lib, ""foo"")'  when the required library sets the property cmake_set_interface_link_directories. (conan-io/conan#10984). Docs: 📃
Fix: Renamed variables from the CMakeToolchain context in blocks to be all lowercase. e.g: CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES to cmake_osx_architectures. (conan-io/conan#10981)
Bugfix: Avoid BazelDeps to find a library when a directory with the same name exists. (conan-io/conan#11090)
Bugfix: The binaryDir field at CMakePresets.json is not set if the conanfile.build_folder is not available, avoiding a null value breaking the specification. (conan-io/conan#11088)
Bugfix: Fixed unziping while using tools.get or tools.unzip with the strip_root=True in a tgz file with hardlinks inside. (conan-io/conan#11074)
Bugfix: The method get_commit from the new conan.tools.scm.Git was capturing a wrong commit, for example, ignoring commits in subfolders when checking the parent folder. (conan-io/conan#11015)
Bugfix: The json generator was showing ""None"" in the version field of the dependencies when the layout() method was used. (conan-io/conan#10960)
Bugfix: The config default_python_requires_id_mode=unrelated_mode raised an error, it has been fixed. (conan-io/conan#10959)
Bugfix: The CMakeToolchain now declares CACHE BOOL variables when a bool is stored in a variable: toolchain.variables[""FOO""] = True. (conan-io/conan#10941)

1.47.0 (31-Mar-2022)

Feature: Renamed tools.build:cppflags to tools.build:defines and removed tools.build:ldflags (now it's the union between tools.build:sharedlinkflags and tools.build:exelinkflags in mostly all the cases). (conan-io/conan#10928). Docs: 📃
Feature: Adding cross-compilation for Android in MesonToolchain. (conan-io/conan#10908). Docs: 📃
Feature: Add extra flags via [conf] into XcodeToolchain. (conan-io/conan#10906). Docs: 📃
Feature: Preliminar support for CMakePresets.json. (conan-io/conan#10903). Docs: 📃
Feature: Added wrap_mode=nofallback project-option into MesonToolchain as default value. (conan-io/conan#10884)
Feature: Added basic rmdir tool at conan.tools.files. (conan-io/conan#10874). Docs: 📃
Feature: Backport of 2.0 compatibility() recipe method. (conan-io/conan#10868)
Feature: Add detection in meson toolchain for cross conditions and requirement of needs_exe_wrapper. Users may specify the exe wrapper in their meson.build now. (conan-io/conan#10846)

Changelog
Sourced from regex's changelog.

1.5.6 (2022-05-20)
This release includes a few bug fixes, including a bug that produced incorrect
matches when a non-greedy ? operator was used.

[BUG #680](rust-lang/regex#680):
Fixes a bug where [[:alnum:][:^ascii:]] dropped [:alnum:] from the class.
[BUG #859](rust-lang/regex#859):
Fixes a bug where Hir::is_match_empty returned false for \b.
[BUG #862](rust-lang/regex#862):
Fixes a bug where 'ab??' matches 'ab' instead of 'a' in 'ab'.

1.5.5 (2022-03-08)
This releases fixes a security bug in the regex compiler. This bug permits a
vector for a denial-of-service attack in cases where the regex being compiled
is untrusted. There are no known problems where the regex is itself trusted,
including in cases of untrusted haystacks.

SECURITY #GHSA-m5pq-gvj9-9vr8:
Fixes a bug in the regex compiler where empty sub-expressions subverted the
existing mitigations in place to enforce a size limit on compiled regexes.
The Rust Security Response WG published an advisory about this:
https://groups.google.com/g/rustlang-security-announcements/c/NcNNL1Jq7Yw
