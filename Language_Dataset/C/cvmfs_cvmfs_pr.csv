Furthermore LocalUploader flags files with FADV_DONTNEED as they are write-once read-never and do not need to be caches extensively.","Findings so far: There is a huge difference between man posix_fadvise and what is actually happening in the kernel. While the documentation suggests posix_fadvise() to somewhat set a ""cache strategy"" for a file, the actual kernel source reveals that:

POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE is a NOOP... thank you very much!
POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED is essentially a readahead() with all pros and cons
POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED is evicting pages immediately but won't change the strategy after the invocation: Hence, the pattern should be: 1. open(), 2. read()/write(), 3. posix_fadvise(), [repeat 2. and 3. ...], close().
posix_fadvise() is conservative for non-page-aligned offsets: it will rather free too little pages rather then purging useful stuff.

So taking all this into account and comparing this pull request against the latest devel on a single-core OpenStack machine with 2GiB RAM (~ 1.8G Page Cache), publishing 50.000 30kB files (~ 1.45GiB) I see a speedup of more than 3x (3:30 vs. 11:00 minutes) where the former virtually doesn't read anything from disk and the latter heavily suffers from page cache thrashing.
Bottom line: As long as the entire CernVM-FS change set fits comfortably into the page cache, we see reasonable performance. Beyond that, also this version will suffer from cache trashing.
What needs to be done:

more measurements

in particular on the test.cern.ch with zfs and more than one core

After cvmfs_server publish-ing a large change set it might take a significant time to clean-out the scratch directory (i.e. /var/spool/cvmfs/<fqrn>/scratch). This allows to run this clean-up asynchronously to allow for quicker publishing round-trips. Setting CVMFS_ASYNC_SCRATCH_CLEANUP=false disables this and reverts back to the legacy behaviour.
The general idea of this workflow is:

create current and wastebin inside /var/spool/cvmfs/<fqrn>/scratch
publish as usual (using .../scratch/current as union fs scratch directory)
umount /cvmfs/<fqrn> and /var/spool/cvmfs/<fqrn>/rdonly
move .../scratch/current into .../wastebin/waste.XXXXXX/current
create a fresh .../scratch/current
spawn daemon process asynchronously deleting everything in .../wastebin
mount /var/spool/cvmfs/<fqrn>/rdonly and /cvmfs/<fqrn>

Note that there might be multiple concurrent cvmfs_suid_helper clear_scratch_async but they should not step on each other's feet. Subject to review: Is this actually true?
Theoretically back-to-back transactions should become quicker but this effect might be mitigated due to the background process stressing the file system with the recursive delete.
Furthermore this requires a repository migration step 2.2.x --> 2.3.0 to be developed.","I'm pretty sure you do, unless you call setsid() to give it a separate process group. Try it.

It seems to be fine (Ubuntu 15.10) with just this double-fork but anyway I've added setsid().
Furthermore I've added a cvmfs_server migrate step for the change in /var/spool/cvmfs/<repo>/scratch. We won't easily get around that, I'm afraid.",True,{}

This might speed up snapshotting significantly in certain situations.
Up to now, a nested catalog was created as soon as cvmfs_server publish hit a .cvmfscatalog file, and removed when it found a deleted .cvmfscatalog file. Conceptually that is fine, but it might lead to many unnecessary catalog updates.
For example: Imagine a user adds a new directory release and marks it a nested catalog (i.e. release/.cvmfscatalog), furthermore she adds 150.000 files to this new directory. In the worst case, cvmfs_server publish would traverse all 150.000 files, adding them to the father catalog of release. Only in the end it would find .cvmfscatalog which forced cvmfs_server publish to split the father at release and copying all 150.000 entries to the new nested catalog.
Similarly this could happen when cvmfs_server publish first finds a deleted .cvmfscatalog file and copys-up all entries into the father just before removing all of them, because actually the entire directory was deleted.
That patch disentangles the creation of nested catalogs from the processing of .cvmfscatalog in cvmfs_server publish. That simplifies the code and also allows to do the catalog creation smarter. I.e. a newly created directory containing a .cvmfspublished file will immediate result in a new (and empty) catalog that gets filled right afterwards. Similarly a removed directory containing .cvmfspublished is deleting an empty catalog and avoids an expensive and useless copy-up.
TODO: In the latter case, it would be even better to just remove the catalog and not even bother deleting all the entries first. But with our main use case directory deletion doesn't happen too often...
Furthermore this adds a test-case to verify the catalog creation/deletion sequencing.","This was on my list since a long time: Disentangling the management of nested catalogs from the processing of .cvmfscatalog in SyncMediator. This might speed up snapshotting significantly in certain situations.

Once upon a time in the old days of CernVM-FS in 2012 @jblomer implemented some retry logic (all together with backoff and timeout) directly in cvmfs_swissknife pull.
This was superseded by a retry logic implementation in an ancient ""download module"" while leaving parts of the old hard-coded logic in place. Later the ""download module"" was replaced by a local DownloadManager object but this brave piece of retry logic survived. While the years were passing the DownloadManager object moved from cvmfs_swissknife pull scope into global and later became managed by the swissknife::Command base class, but the little piece of code stayed with us in silence.
It didn't do anything useful since the beginning of 2013, but after I blindly removed the ""logically dead"" condition ""that could never be true"", Coverity was talking about, the remainings of the little hard-coded retry logic unleashed its power and downloaded each and every file three times.

Apologies for the large number of changes.  @bbockelm Apologies for screwing up git blame; all the meat is a copy & paste of your code, it just turned out to be easier to use the editor than git commands.
Principal change is a better separation between the cvmfs client and the authorization helper, including a well-defined interface between the two. The authorization helper executable needs to be defined in CVMFS_AUTHZ_HELPER.  Actually we might want to be smarter and define a naming convention to automatically deduct the authorization helper from the authz string in the catalog.  Currently there is of course only one (X.509 proxy) but we might see others in the future. @bbockelm, what do you think?
The new helper cvmfs_x509_helper also comes with its own spec file so that it can be developed and deployed independently from cvmfs (e.g. faster).
I'm still wondering if we want to have a dedicated audit log (different from debug log, syslog), to log all authorization relevant events.  In particular successful/failed authorizations, of course.
Regarding the interface: the helper gets spawned by the cvmfs client with stdin/stdout connected.  There is a command/reply style of messages.  Messages have a 4 byte version (=1), a 4 byte length, and then a JSON text that needs to contain the top-level struct cvmfs_authz_v1 { ... }.  Communication starts with a handshake where the client passes logging parameters to the authz helper.  The client then sends zero or more authorization requests that are answered by a positive or negative permit each that includes the access token for positive permits (in this case: X.509 proxy).  The permits are cached by the client with a TTL that the helper can chose.  On unmount, the client sends a quit command to the helper.
The download manager got an abstract interface of a class that can perform per-transfer surgery on CURL handles.  This way, the download manager does not need to know about authz internals.
All in all, I don't think we can make this modification part of a bugfix release with a clear conscience.

I had always planned to provide a prefix of some sort (x509:/DC=ch/DC=.../CN=Brian versus voms:/cms versus oauth2:some-great-authz) in the future.  If we are already doing this much work, we might as well add it now.  I assume we ought to ignore prefixes that are not understood and fall back to the current logic for things starting with /?
I agree it's becoming a bit disingenuous to call this a bugfix (although it certainly does fix a bug...).  On the other hand, I really need something I can deliver to LIGO relatively soon.

Hm, but you are right that for the distributed case it might make more sense to fill a staging buffer before storing things in the key-value store.  In fact, most distributed key-value stores have a hard limit on the object size at around 1MB.  So I guess what we really want is multi-part objects in the key-value store.

Among them

There was a subtle problem with the lower cache tier: during a transactional write, the cache manager gets to know the path in /cvmfs that triggers addition of the object and the object type (catalog, regular file, ...).  This is information is lost during copy-up.  The cache manager interface is now changed: to open an object, the content hash needs to be ""blessed"" with the additional information.  This information is available at the time of open.
Simple unit test and integration test.  I think eventually we should run all client tests with several cache manager options.
Removal of the (rather unnecessary) cache namespace.
Virtual open file descriptors (as needed for the RAM cache and later the external cache) are factored out as independent data structure.

Missing is a proper configuraton of the cache manager(s), as discussed in CVM-1053.
The biggest hurdle I see with reloading/hotpatching support.  Clients need to save and restore their state.  For the traditional cache manager, that's easy because the open files are maintained by the OS for the cvmfs process.  For other cache managers, we need to ensure that the state of open files survies a reload.","Based on #1615, a few fixes and additions.  Among them

The CI failure on MacOS is due to Travis removing old OSX images. We ask for 7.1 (internal Travis version number) and we get routed to 7.3.1, where we don't need to install cmake. To fix this issue, the .travis.yml file in the devel branch needs to be backported into the 2.3 branch.
This is just a quick fix, however. In January I've planned some work to ensure that we are again able to build on the latest version of MacOS - we are now building on OSX Yosemite 10.10, due to the removal of OpenSSL headers in 10.11 and 10.12. One this is done, this should make our Travis jobs and the entire MacOS build and packaging process more reliable.",True,{}

Summary:

Adds the Boost smart_ptr module as an external dependency. This module is header-only, it introduces no new library dependencies. The smart_ptr headers and their requirements are extracted from the Boost sources, to avoid exploding the size of the CVMFS sources (The complete Boost sources are ~80MB compressed, while the smart_ptr sources are ~400kB compressed).
The smart pointer classes are: scoped_ptr - single copy owning pointer, like UniquePtr from CVMFS, shared_ptr - a shared ownership pointer based on reference counting, weak_ptr - a pointer for maintaining weak, non-owning references to shared_ptr and intrusive_ptr - reference-counted pointer which maintains the reference count in the managed object itself.
The smart pointer classes from Boost are the basis of the design of the smart pointers from the C++11 standard. Using the smart pointers from Boost makes a potential future upgrade to C++11 smart pointers very simple (substitute boost namespace for std, substitute scoped_ptr for unique_ptr etc.).
The Boost smart pointers do not require any special C++ compiler support, they compile on any C++98 compiler. The branch has been tested on all the platforms that we support (see results) and also on CentOS 5 with the default compiler - GCC 4.1 (Note: on CentOS 4 and 5 CVMFS is compiled with a newer version of GCC from our yum repos).

POWER8, ARM64

I submitted a new CvmfsIncrementalBuild job to test building+unit tests for the latest version of the branch. I included the Arm64 configuration this time (but it may also hang like the nightly builds...)
(Update: Arm64 is hanging during the CvmfsSetupBuildEnvironment stage).
I don't know what difference these platforms will make, though. The implementation of smart pointers is very basic. I expect that in the smart pointer code there is some branching based on compiler, less branching based on platform.

Stack traces

You will not see anything, unless you capture a stack trace at the exact moment the smart pointer is constructed or destroyed. In any case, shared pointers are implemented without ""magic"" - just a reference count somewhere, either an atomic integer, or an integer and a lock.
Intrusive smart pointers (I haven't used their implementation from Boost or the C++11 standard lib) are more... intrusive (to have a type be reference countable with intrusive pointers, the type needs to be derived from the intrusive pointer itself, which ensures that the reference count is with the object, not elsewhere), but even there I wouldn't expect to see anything in the stack trace.

Adding a new C++ dependency.

It's not difficult to write a basic shared pointer implementation. On the other hand, writing something that works consistently across platforms and covers any corner case is much more difficult. Another example: we can easily write a simple key-value store. Re-writing LevelDB for our purpose is not feasable.
The smart_ptr module is quite old and has seen a lot of use, which is why the smart pointer implementation and API in C++11 is based on it. I think that when it comes to risk you can do much worse than with a core module of Boost. One can disagree with the designs of some of the very templated libraries, but the core libraries are really good quality.
On the other hand, it may happen that in the future there is a compilation error because I didn't include all the headers files (I had to extract them manually from the Boost sources). In that case it's just a matter of adding the missing files to fix the problem (I already had to do this twice, on macOS and Fedora).
Bottom line, I'm not worried about depending on Boost smart pointers. However, I am worried about memory errors and leaks with manual memory management.
I was wondering if we are running Valgrind as part of the CI suite? I can't find it in Jenkins. I'm running Valgrind manually on the unit tests and it definitely sees memory leaks. Of course, some of them would be in the server tools (maybe less severe), hopefully none or few are in the FUSE client (very bad, imagine). (Update: I found the valgrind.md documentation + test functions).",True,{}

So far, storing the revision was enough, but now the revision became a two dimensional (branch, revision).  To ensure root catalogs are unique, we could instead store a UUID in the root catalog.  As for the user interface, users can lookup the catalog revision already through extended attributes.  So it might make sense for them to be able to query both to distinguish catalog revision X on two different branches.
Then again, I expect that users access branched tags anyway through the .cvmfs/snapshots directory of the latest catalog. And we can also argue that tags and branches are sort of annotations to an existing repository.
I guess storing the branch doesn't hurt much for the time being.  I could remove the access to the branch through extended attributes so that we don't commit to the branch being stored in the root catalog.",True,{}

If you want me to go ahead and stick with 16K anyway and ignore the API, please confirm and I will change it.  The value for getgrnam_r does start out at only 1K (at least on el6) so it takes 4 doublings to get to 16K and is less efficient when it has to do that.
The API for getpwnam_r is different than getgrnam_r.  According to the el6 man page, the former says to just use the value of the sysconf variable and that tells you the maximum size.   On the other hand, I just checked and the el7 man page's description is just like getgrnam_r, where you are to retry with a larger buffer if you get ERANGE.  Oh, I see that the el6 man page says there is also ERANGE if you give it too small of a value, so it should be alright there too.
The Mac getgrnam_r man page doesn't say anything about sysconf nor does it say that it can return an ERANGE error if the buffer is too small.  It does say that it can return an error value but doesn't say what the errors can be.

I'm thinking about where to put the log files. In the cvmfs_services application the lager_syslog backend is configured with a cvmfs_services identity and an rsyslog configuration file for the application is installed into /etc/rsyslog.d. The log files are created and owned by the syslog user. I think this is a clean way to do it, probably facilitates the integration with system-wide log rotation tools.

Yes the Conflicts clause prevents two cvmfs-config packages from being installed concurrently.  I thought that was what we wanted.  I still think that's what we want; I think that the name cvmfs-config should be reserved for a base configuration package which does conflict with other base configuration packages, even if they don't install the same files.  For example, they probably would all (except for cvmfs-config-none) define a config repository.  Of course people can create other cvmfs-config-* packages which do not Provide & Conflict with cvmfs-config.
Even though cvmfs-config-none does not set a config repository, its intention is to allow people to not install any base config repository, so I think it should also Provide & Conflict with cvmfs-config.   In fact when I was testing this PR I found that I had accidentally installed an old version of cvmfs-config-none that did not have the Conflict, and I was having trouble figuring out why it wasn't installing cvmfs-config-default.
By having the Conflicts statement there, when somebody does apt-get install cvmfs-config it says that cvmfs-config is a virtual package and lists all the possible packages to choose from.",True,{}

I believe we could discuss if we want another class that has the MultiShot behaviour and leaving signal SingleShot, however, this one, is a quite tricky API to manage and I figure out this SingleShot behaviour only by chance...","I believe we are save.
There is only one other place where Signal is used: https://github.com/cvmfs/cvmfs/blob/devel/cvmfs/cache_extern.h#L252-L258
However the Signal is stack initialized, make it Wait and immediately destroyed here: https://github.com/cvmfs/cvmfs/blob/devel/cvmfs/cache_extern.cc#L111-L120
Then there is a single Wakeup: https://github.com/cvmfs/cvmfs/blob/devel/cvmfs/cache_extern.cc#L542
So after this last Wakeup Signal just get destroyed.
The change is such that it modify the behaviour only with multiple call of Wait, in our case we are safe.
Anyway we should discuss if we want to maintain the Single Shot semantic for Signal and create a new class for Multi Shot.",True,{}

This pull request causes /etc/fuse.conf to be replaced by a symbolic link to /etc/fuse.conf.cvmfs which has been transformed from its packaged value by a simple sed operation that removes the comment in front of user_allow_other.
Additionally, a backup created at /etc/fuse.conf.cvmfs-orig; upon removal of the package /etc/fuse.conf is replaced by /etc/fuse.conf.cvmfs-orig and the latter is deleted.
The only thing to maintain in this package is a single line withinpackaging/debian/cvmfs/cvmfs.transform that modifies /etc/fuse.conf as packaged by fuse to that as needed by cvmfs.

The ticket contains a link to a documentation update that is incomplete. autofs need not only be running but you must reload or restart the service. You should expect a cvmfs-contrib package soon that sets up autofs out-of-the-box; on Debian it will do the reload/restart (because on Debian that's normal) while on RedHat it will be up the user (because on RedHat that's normal).",True,{}

In order to fix the SL4/5 builds, you'd need to evaluate BUILD_GEOAPI in bootstrap.sh when it comes to building ipaddress and maxminddb.  The BUILD_GEOAPI should be defined in cmake/Modules/cvmfs_options.cmake and it needs to be exported as an environment variable like for BUILD_SERVER in order to be available in the bootstrap.sh script.
On the Debian and Ubuntu platforms, building of maxminddb now starts but it fails with

Here's what I would improve, though:


The Carbon server IP, port etc. should not be hardcoded, but given as commandline parameters. You can use the argparse module to implement all the commandline parameter handling.


By default, the script should be ""one-shot"": it starts, it looks for any new rows, pickles them, uploads them and stops. The continuous mode can be optional.


You could create an auxiliary file alongside stats.db in /var/spool/cvmfs/<REPO> to store some information about which rows have already been uploaded. I think storing the number of rows and last uploaded timestamps would be useful. You can then implement the logic for only uploading new rows.",True,{}

I think the cvmfs_swissknife ingest command should take the following steps:

Try to get a lease for the relevant path - if not possible, abort and inform the user (they can call cvmfs_server abort if there is an existing lease that conflicts).
Perform the tarball ingestion
Make sure that FinalizeSession(true, ....) is called on the Spooler object to commit the transaction on the gateway (see how it's done in swissknife_sync.cc):

There can only be one active lease on each publisher machine and the session token is saved in /var/spool/cvmfs/<REPO>/session_token_. cvmfs_swissknife lease -a acquire should give an error if there is an active lease.

The switch is necessary since we want to create a library libcvmfs_server.so where a raw aborting is not desiderable. However we would like to keep the original behaviour in the binaries.
The first idea was to have a much simpler function that using pre-compilation condition would either simply abort() (for the binaries) or throw an exception string (for the library).
This approach would imply to find good descriptive string for all the abort in the code. Some abort do not have any message associate with (implying that we don't expect them to ever been called), other are preceded by a log (implying that we are facing a known error condition).
Overall it seems complex to find reasonable string messages for all the panics and to format those messages correctly.
The proposed approach will allow to automatically replace either the call to plain abort(void) with a call to Panic(void) or the call to LogCvmfs(source, mask, format, ...) to a call to Panic(source, mask, format, ...) leaving untouched the original semantic of the calls.

This should keep the memory utilization of the new tracker under control.
For loading tensorflow, e.g., some 3000 entries get added to the cache. Starting ATLAS HelloWorld adds some 25000 entries to the negative cache, resulting in ~1.4M additional memory consumption.  This space is freed after 1 minute, i.e. after expiry of the kernel cache.","This PR introduces a new kernel cache tracker, the nentry tracker, in order to allow for active cache eviction of negative entries.

The main contributions of this PR are two.
First of all, is now possible to compute the ChainID of a docker image.
The Image struct gains another method GetDiffIDs which returns a list of hashes (the docker DiffIDs). These hashes can be plugged into the new ChainID code to produce the list of ChainIDs on which a docker image is based upon.
Then, we create a new function ApplyDirectory(bottom, top) that simulate an union file system, applying the content of the top directory to the bottom one. The bottom directory is modified.

If I understand correctly we would:

first create a replica,
then set CVMFS_GEO_DB_FILE and
finally call the update-geodb

I was trying to avoid step 2 and 3 and it was getting quite complex. If this is enough I am more than happy with the result.
On similar notes, with Jakob we were thinking how to avoid the user to set the CVMFS_GEO_DB_FILE variable at all and use the system provided one.
Do you think it would be a good idea to check if the file is present in the default locations? And if it is present use the most recently updated one?
The default location at the moment are /usr/share/GeoIP for debs packages and and /var/lib/GeoIP for rpms.",True,{}

The implementation seems wrong, and, sometimes it creates catalogs of size zero but with content.
I believe the problem is in the use of the libarchive library, but I was unable to actually understand completely what is going on.
This PR takes a much cleaner approach to the creation of nested catalogs.

Maybe it is worth to release this on 2.7.2 if you guys agree.","linter finished with errors:

client side.
This was suppose to be one of the first tasks of the summer student. Nevertheless I believe it is important to keep this development line open as well.
It would be interesting to have a command to spit out just this numbers so that we can compare the performance on the client programmatically from different installation and user bases.
At the moment the output produced is somehow like this:

Maybe it is worth to release this on 2.7.2 if you guys agree.","building for cloudtests finished: SUCCESS

client side.
This was suppose to be one of the first tasks of the summer student. Nevertheless I believe it is important to keep this development line open as well.
It would be interesting to have a command to spit out just this numbers so that we can compare the performance on the client programmatically from different installation and user bases.
At the moment the output produced is somehow like this:

Maybe it is worth to release this on 2.7.2 if you guys agree.","building for cloudtests finished: SUCCESS

client side.
This was suppose to be one of the first tasks of the summer student. Nevertheless I believe it is important to keep this development line open as well.
It would be interesting to have a command to spit out just this numbers so that we can compare the performance on the client programmatically from different installation and user bases.
At the moment the output produced is somehow like this:

I hadn't thought it through enough to realize it would only work on stratum 0s, but of course that's the case.  The smallest repository I found that was affected was geant4.cern.ch, so on my test stratum 1 I converted that repository into a stratum 0 with rmfs -p and import -t -r.  It required a masterkey which I didn't have handy so I created a temporary repository, copied the .masterkey and .pub, and deleted the temporary repository.  I had quite a hassle with import complaining about no .cvmfsreflog so I should delete reflog.chksum, but there was no such file.  I figured out it was reading the hash from .cvmfspublished, and was able to get it to work after downloading .cvmfsreflog from the FNAL stratum 1.  I ran eliminate-bulk-hashes, enabled gc and ran it, but it didn't delete the bulk files.  Now I'm taking a fresh snapshot which should hopefully do it.",True,{}

I then deleted all tags except for trunk and trunk-previous and did a couple of more transaction/publishes.  I then ran gc, and it did not reduce the size at all.  I then took a fresh snapshot, and the du -ks size went down from 7522171287 to 4790299925, that is, 2.5T!
However, not all larger files were eliminated.   In the data/00 directory, there are 3 files bigger than 17000K:

I found there are 487 remaining files greater than 17000K compressed, adding up to only 15G.  It's not worth doing anything about them to save space, but if the files are still accessed I'd be concerned about the impact they might have on squids. All but 8 are less than 100M, and only two are more than 160M (a 311M and a 556M) so maybe I'll only ask them to republish those.

That will need further investigation before this is merged but I wanted to get it started being reviewed, and maybe someone else knows the answer to this problem.",Replaced by #2586,True,{}

hack it around, adding another parameter to the JSON creator to decide if escape or not the strings.

The approach I considered are:

Create a temp file, I need to delete those files if not needed (most of the times) and I would rely on some RAII, that eventually will not work when we switch to exceptions.
Create a temp file, save the path, delete immediately the file. I don't like the idea of making the system call only to get the path of the file and immediately delete it. But it is a strong candidate.
Write on os.getenv(""TMP"") some configuration won't have the variable set. Especially weird one that run inside jenkins or other CI
Just write on /tmp it is the less correct option, but the most pragmatic. Everybody understand it and it will work on most systems and it is simple to understand also for operators.

Hi @siscia , I needed to process some extra layer info while downloading it. This info is not needed for converting the wish for docker. Hence, I sent a flag to avoid extra computing time if we are not converting for podman!.

But it would be unfortunate and could lead to confusion if different communities or organizations had different names of the special variable that users have to know in order to enable CDN use.
For that matter, it would be nice if there was a keyword like ""CDN"" so you could do something like
CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY=""CDN;DIRECT"" but that would sort of bend the concept of the proxy list and the server list ; it could be hard to implement that behaviour in a way that maintains consistency.",True,{}

While this is not an immediate problem for us, it would be nice to stay up to date.
The main objective of this PR is to allow to create a CVMFS repo over HTTPS on S3 backend storage.
While reaching for this objective we also tidy up a little bit several pieces of code.
More checks are necessary, especially on the client side, but this PR might accidentally have add support for serving CVMFS over HTTPS.
Progression
We started by introducing another option CVMFS_S3_USE_HTTPS (default to false) that force CVMFS to communicate to the S3 backend over HTTPS.
The next problem was to detect all the time the string ""http"" was hardcoded.
They were mostly checks if the files is local or remote, we allow remote URI to start also with https and not only with http.
At this point we could start to make HTTPS requests, however they all failed since no CA authority was recognized.
There was some checks already in place, on the client part, to add CA authorities. We use to check either the directory pointed by X509_CERT_DIR or the directory in /etc/grid-security/certificates.
I refactor this check to work in:

the directory pointed by X509_CERT_DIR
/etc/grid-security/certificates
/etc/ssl/certs/
other less used directories

We try to be smart about which directory to load. Hopefully it will just work in all systems.
Then we make sure to enable the HTTPS checks and to load the certificates only if necessary.
During the development we also enable the errorbuffer provided by libcurl. It is not strictly necessary but it can provide useful information when something failed and I would suggest to leave it on.

More checks are necessary, especially on the client side, but this PR might accidentally have add support for serving CVMFS over HTTPS.
Progression
We started by introducing another option CVMFS_S3_USE_HTTPS (default to false) that force CVMFS to communicate to the S3 backend over HTTPS.
The next problem was to detect all the time the string ""http"" was hardcoded.
They were mostly checks if the files is local or remote, we allow remote URI to start also with https and not only with http.
At this point we could start to make HTTPS requests, however they all failed since no CA authority was recognized.
There was some checks already in place, on the client part, to add CA authorities. We use to check either the directory pointed by X509_CERT_DIR or the directory in /etc/grid-security/certificates.
I refactor this check to work in:

the directory pointed by X509_CERT_DIR
/etc/grid-security/certificates
/etc/ssl/certs/
other less used directories

We try to be smart about which directory to load. Hopefully it will just work in all systems.
Then we make sure to enable the HTTPS checks and to load the certificates only if necessary.
During the development we also enable the errorbuffer provided by libcurl. It is not strictly necessary but it can provide useful information when something failed and I would suggest to leave it on.
One last touch was to enable by default the signature V4 instead of the V2 for S3. It seems that some S3 provider support only the V4.

The sign is called inside runuser ( here the call ) and this reset the environmental variables that should signal to the download manager to use the system certificates. The system certificates are not loaded, and we cannot reach the HTTPS storage.

While this is not an immediate problem for us, it would be nice to stay up to date.
The main objective of this PR is to allow to create a CVMFS repo over HTTPS on S3 backend storage.
While reaching for this objective we also tidy up a little bit several pieces of code.
More checks are necessary, especially on the client side, but this PR might accidentally have add support for serving CVMFS over HTTPS.
Progression
We started by introducing another option CVMFS_S3_USE_HTTPS (default to false) that force CVMFS to communicate to the S3 backend over HTTPS.
The next problem was to detect all the time the string ""http"" was hardcoded.
They were mostly checks if the files is local or remote, we allow remote URI to start also with https and not only with http.
At this point we could start to make HTTPS requests, however they all failed since no CA authority was recognized.
There was some checks already in place, on the client part, to add CA authorities. We use to check either the directory pointed by X509_CERT_DIR or the directory in /etc/grid-security/certificates.
I refactor this check to work in:

the directory pointed by X509_CERT_DIR
/etc/grid-security/certificates
/etc/ssl/certs/
other less used directories

We try to be smart about which directory to load. Hopefully it will just work in all systems.
Then we make sure to enable the HTTPS checks and to load the certificates only if necessary.
During the development we also enable the errorbuffer provided by libcurl. It is not strictly necessary but it can provide useful information when something failed and I would suggest to leave it on.
One last touch was to enable by default the signature V4 instead of the V2 for S3. It seems that some S3 provider support only the V4.

CURLOPT_URL in DownloadManager::SetUrlOptions().  This causes any such
URIs to be treated as invalid and hence requests will eventually fail
with kFailBadUrl.
Fix by adding '@' to the list of characters that do not require URI
escaping.  The '@' character has no special meaning outside of the
user information field, and so this will not alter the interpretation
of any other part of the URI.

There are two objectives:


cvmfs can become a package in fedora or opensuse (or debian) and thus become available to a much broader audience. For this cvmfs packaging has to follow the distro rules of course. A clean OBS or COPR build proves that to the distro. This also requires the spec file to have the proper name cvmfs.spec.


If a cvmfs build based on OBS ""service links"" (or equivalent in COPR) exists and works it is practically zero work for the cvmfs team to support TW, and various other opensuse variants, Fedora, Centos8 etc pp. OBS (or COPR) automatically rebuilds for any upstream changes, and also for any dependency package changes in the distro. If you do it yourself, you'll have to maintain and update a TW VM frequently and manually, and that is guaranteed to fall behind and become inconsistent.",True,{}

I would like to provide from our infrastructure a SLES15 build (see JIRA ticket). Assuming that such a build works fine on Tumbleweed, too, I don't think we would add an extra build & test node for the rolling release.

Thats a long shot, TW is meant to integrate upstream changes, so by construction you can't rely on TW being compatible with sle15. Quite often it is, but you can't rely on it. TW really needs a constantly updated build tracking TW changes. That is actually my original motivation for doing the OBS build.

Making 3rd party builds easy is great to figure out potential problems early on and to enable cvmfs on less used platforms. However, we'll continue to provide our prebuilt packages on a set of core / production platforms in order to facilitate the support. In case of problems, we give priority to the issues that come from binaries that were built in a well-controlled environment and where we have the infrastructure to reproduce problems readily available.

Yes sure. But it isolates you from your user community, because nobody can do the build in exactly the same way as you do it. When I worked with opensuse on the fuse crashes they gave us kernels built on OBS with their patches, that was very quick and transparent.",True,{}

The error I'm seeing locally is
PANIC: /home/mcb30/work/extcvs/cvmfs/cvmfs/catalog_mgr_rw.cc : 928
failed to swap nested catalog '/a': already attached

I think the problem is that the call to output_catalog_mgr_->TouchDirectory() ends up calling FindCatalog() and therefore attaching the old catalog:

  
    
      cvmfs/cvmfs/catalog_mgr_rw.cc
    
    
        Lines 703 to 707
      in
      65dd008
    
  
  
    

        
          
           WritableCatalog *catalog; 
        

        
          
           if (!FindCatalog(parent_path, &catalog)) { 
        

        
          
             PANIC(kLogStderr, ""catalog for entry '%s' cannot be found"", 
        

        
          
                   entry_path.c_str()); 
        

        
          
           } 
        
    
  


This violates the precondition that the old catalog has not been previously attached, and (correctly) triggers the PANIC error.
It feels as though SwapNestedCatalog() ought to be allowed to handle the situation in which the old catalog happens to be already attached, with the overall effect being similar to first calling RemoveNestedCatalog() with merge=false.

Done.
I also had to modify the code to use
const bool found = new_catalog_mgr->LookupNested(path, ...)
rather than
const bool found = new_catalog_mgr->LookupNested(rel_path, ...)
It seems as though MakeRelative() strips off any leading slash, while MakeRelativePath() inserts a leading slash. 😕

As far as I can tell, all of the existing code that handles this kind of thing does so by mounting the nested catalog and updating the root directory entry in the nested catalog to match the transition point directory entry in the parent catalog.  Since we're trying to avoid touching the new nested catalog, I'm assuming that we should do basically the reverse: get the root directory entry from the freely attached new catalog object, and use that to update the transition point directory entry in the parent catalog?

Updated - SwapNestedCatalog() now looks up the root directory entry from the freely attached new catalog object, and applies it using:
  dirent.set_is_nested_catalog_mountpoint(true);
  dirent.set_is_nested_catalog_root(false);
  parent->UpdateEntry(dirent, nested_root_path);
  parent->TouchEntry(dirent, xattrs, nested_root_path);
It seems to be necessary to use both UpdateEntry() and TouchEntry() - AFAICT the former is required to update the link count and the latter is required to update the extended attributes.
This now passes the updated test 802 and I have verified that the test code really is checking counters etc (by temporarily hacking out the call to PopulateToParent()).

It does support grafting a mixture of compressed and uncompressed files in the same transaction, but my primary motivation was to make the process of using uncompressed files less confusing by recording the compression information within the graft metadata so that the publisher does the right thing without requiring the user to know about setting CVMFS_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHM.

Also looks as though the S3 tests are failing because /srv/cvmfs/<repo> doesn't exist on those platforms, which is reasonable enough.  Is there a standard way for CVMFS test scripts to inject content-addressed files directly into whatever functions as the storage backend?

Signed-off-by: Michael Brown mbrown@fensystems.co.uk","I'm actually surprised that nested_catalog->RemoveFromParent() does not cause any problems in the current implementation of SwapNestedCatalog. Shouldn't it distort the catalog counters?

I believe RemoveFromParent() already has to successfully update the counters to compensate for the removed catalog, and the revised version of the patch then applies the modifications due solely to adding the new catalog.  This seems to work as expected, based on the integration test results.

I think we can go a little bit different about this: currently we are already trying to find the nested catalog in the tree of attached catalogs. We fail if we find it. Instead, if we find it we can check with GetModifiedCatalogLeafsRecursively() if the nested tree has any changes recorded (it must not).
Since we have the catalog already open, we can then reuse that open file and don't need to redownload it.
I think from RemoveNestedCatalog we then only need the DetachCatalog call (actually better a DetachSubtree call), and we don't need to make the mutex recursive.

OK, will have a go at implementing this approach.",True,{}

Signed-off-by: Michael Brown mbrown@fensystems.co.uk","@jblomer Thanks for helping me establish a test environment that reproduces the CI builders.  I think I've found the root cause - systemctl stop doesn't work on any autofs mounts, since there is no generated mount unit for those.
I tried extending this PR to always perform both systemctl stop and umount, so as to be able to cope with both autofs and fstab mount points, but it's getting to be far too messy.
I still believe that avoiding systemctl altogether is the correct solution (which would require finding an alternative fix for CVM-1398).  However, an alternative change that at least fixes the symptoms on Fedora 34 is to use systemctl restart instead of systemctl start - that is sufficient to make the mount happen as expected even when mixed with manual umounts.
Closing this in favour of #2752, which implements the systemctl restart approach.",True,{}

So are there any cases that a proxy will return a 503 Service Unavailable in less than 10 seconds that really is a problem on the proxy?

Yes, these situations do exist:

A proxy in maintenance mode will return a 503 Service Unavailable
An overloaded proxy will return a 503 Service Unavailable
A proxy suffering a temporary DNS outage will return a 503 Service Unavailable

This is a case of type 1 vs type 2 errors:

If the origin server returns 503 but CVMFS considers it to be a proxy error, then CVMFS will erroneously send some more requests to the same origin server.  This will degrade service slightly.
If the proxy server returns 503 but CVMFS considers it to be an origin server error, then CVMFS will erroneously abandon the entire request and return EIO to the application.  This will cause a total failure of the service.  (We have observed this happening in real-world deployments.)

Given these impacts and since it is plausible that the 503 could be generated by either the proxy or the origin server, the safest course of action is to assume that it represents a proxy error.",True,{}

Proxy-Status: SomeCDN; error=destination_unavailable

Not specifically for this implementation.  The overall approach of using consistent hashing is a very well-known design that improves cache locality when multiple caching proxies are in use, and the overall impact on system performance is going to depend heavily on the cache system design and implementation.
For us, this will be eliminating a separate sharding layer that is currently implemented using haproxy, and the impact will therefore be reduced bandwidth and CPU consumption since traffic does not first need to pass through an haproxy instance before reaching the real caching proxy.
The cost of performing the balanced tree lookup on each request is negligible in comparison to any download time, and so I would not expect to be able to measure any impact from this extra code path.  The (re)construction of the balanced tree happens only in the event of a proxy configuration change or proxy failure, which is sufficiently rare to make the cost also negligible.

Most of the PR deals with cleaning up the existing code, and I'd suggest merging it even without the ability to shard across multiple proxies.  The extra code that implements the sharding logic is isolated to about 20 lines of code in UpdateProxiesUnlocked(): I've deliberately kept it clean and simple.

Sends 0 as channel to the gateway, with a similar comment

Versioning and Release
This document details the versioning and release plan for containerd. Stability
is a top goal for this project and we hope that this document and the processes
it entails will help to achieve that. It covers the release process, versioning
numbering, backporting, API stability and support horizons.
If you rely on containerd, it would be good to spend time understanding the
areas of the API that are and are not supported and how they impact your
project in the future.
This document will be considered a living document. Supported timelines,
backport targets and API stability guarantees will be updated here as they
change.
If there is something that you require or this document leaves out, please
reach out by filing an issue.
Releases
Releases of containerd will be versioned using dotted triples, similar to
Semantic Version. For the purposes of this document, we
will refer to the respective components of this triple as
<major>.<minor>.<patch>. The version number may have additional information,
such as alpha, beta and release candidate qualifications. Such releases will be
considered ""pre-releases"".
Major and Minor Releases
Major and minor releases of containerd will be made from main. Releases of
containerd will be marked with GPG signed tags and announced at
https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases. The tag will be of the
format v<major>.<minor>.<patch> and should be made with the command git tag -s v<major>.<minor>.<patch>.
After a minor release, a branch will be created, with the format
release/<major>.<minor> from the minor tag. All further patch releases will
be done from that branch. For example, once we release v1.0.0, a branch
release/1.0 will be created from that tag. All future patch releases will be
done against that branch.
Pre-releases
Pre-releases, such as alphas, betas and release candidates will be conducted
from their source branch. For major and minor releases, these releases will be
done from main. For patch releases, these pre-releases should be done within
the corresponding release branch.
While pre-releases are done to assist in the stabilization process, no
guarantees are provided.

Versioning and Release
This document details the versioning and release plan for containerd. Stability
is a top goal for this project and we hope that this document and the processes
it entails will help to achieve that. It covers the release process, versioning
numbering, backporting, API stability and support horizons.
If you rely on containerd, it would be good to spend time understanding the
areas of the API that are and are not supported and how they impact your
project in the future.
This document will be considered a living document. Supported timelines,
backport targets and API stability guarantees will be updated here as they
change.
If there is something that you require or this document leaves out, please
reach out by filing an issue.
Releases
Releases of containerd will be versioned using dotted triples, similar to
Semantic Version. For the purposes of this document, we
will refer to the respective components of this triple as
<major>.<minor>.<patch>. The version number may have additional information,
such as alpha, beta and release candidate qualifications. Such releases will be
considered ""pre-releases"".
Major and Minor Releases
Major and minor releases of containerd will be made from main. Releases of
containerd will be marked with GPG signed tags and announced at
https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases. The tag will be of the
format v<major>.<minor>.<patch> and should be made with the command git tag -s v<major>.<minor>.<patch>.
After a minor release, a branch will be created, with the format
release/<major>.<minor> from the minor tag. All further patch releases will
be done from that branch. For example, once we release v1.0.0, a branch
release/1.0 will be created from that tag. All future patch releases will be
done against that branch.
Pre-releases
Pre-releases, such as alphas, betas and release candidates will be conducted
from their source branch. For major and minor releases, these releases will be
done from main. For patch releases, these pre-releases should be done within
the corresponding release branch.
While pre-releases are done to assist in the stabilization process, no
guarantees are provided.

Changelog
Sourced from github.com/containerd/containerd's changelog.

Versioning and Release
This document details the versioning and release plan for containerd. Stability
is a top goal for this project and we hope that this document and the processes
it entails will help to achieve that. It covers the release process, versioning
numbering, backporting, API stability and support horizons.
If you rely on containerd, it would be good to spend time understanding the
areas of the API that are and are not supported and how they impact your
project in the future.
This document will be considered a living document. Supported timelines,
backport targets and API stability guarantees will be updated here as they
change.
If there is something that you require or this document leaves out, please
reach out by filing an issue.
Releases
Releases of containerd will be versioned using dotted triples, similar to
Semantic Version. For the purposes of this document, we
will refer to the respective components of this triple as
<major>.<minor>.<patch>. The version number may have additional information,
such as alpha, beta and release candidate qualifications. Such releases will be
considered ""pre-releases"".
Major and Minor Releases
Major and minor releases of containerd will be made from main. Releases of
containerd will be marked with GPG signed tags and announced at
https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases. The tag will be of the
format v<major>.<minor>.<patch> and should be made with the command git tag -s v<major>.<minor>.<patch>.
After a minor release, a branch will be created, with the format
release/<major>.<minor> from the minor tag. All further patch releases will
be done from that branch. For example, once we release v1.0.0, a branch
release/1.0 will be created from that tag. All future patch releases will be
done against that branch.
Pre-releases
Pre-releases, such as alphas, betas and release candidates will be conducted
from their source branch. For major and minor releases, these releases will be
done from main. For patch releases, these pre-releases should be done within
the corresponding release branch.
While pre-releases are done to assist in the stabilization process, no
guarantees are provided.
