I have made changes as they have been suggested, except for 'router_options', as they are already used by readconnroute (dbseerroute is basically readconnroute + logging feature). I have added separate options in the configure_new_service function instead, while removing them from process_config_update as then do not need to be updated on the fly.
I have also made changes in tpmfilter to use MXS_FREE and MXS_STRDUP_A instead of vanilla C functions.
I am not sure how to pass the required information so that tpmfilter can do the same job as the dbseerroute at this point. If you have any suggestions, I am more than happy to work on that as well.",True,{}

SELECT @@global.binlog_checksum
should be the same we already save in router->saved_master.chksum2 via
SET @master_binlog_checksum = @@global.binlog_checksum"")
and
SELECT @master_binlog_checksum""
So you can just add in blr_slave.c:
else if (strcasecmp(word, ""@master_binlog_checksum"") == 0) || (strcasecmp(word, ""@@global.binlog_checksum"") == 0))

and remove the field binlog_checksum in MASTER_RESPONSES struct.
SET sql_mode='NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES';
SET character_set_results = NULL;
These SET can return either an error or OK packet (without any status message)
If this is always true, OK without messages, you can remove these fields in MASTER_RESPONSES struct: results_charset and sql_mode because you don't need to store the results (blr_master.c)
In blr_slave.c just return blr_slave_send_ok(router, slave); when those SET are requested.
SET commands can alter the MaxScale to Master registration phase.
I suggest to create an option,say 'maxwell_compatibility=0|1, where default is 0.
This way alle the new queries and SET are sent only in the option is 1.
Of course the mysql-connector-j version string must be handled some how: say an option that specify a file to read or just a new router_option.
Another improvement I can see is:
instead of using SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'log_bin', SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_format',SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_row_image'
SELECT @@global.log_bin, @@global.binlog_format, @@global.binlog_row_image;
then you could parse the result with blr_extract_column(buf, 1); (1,2,3)
This way you can set the router->saved_master.xyz response (only one) and you don't add the BLRM_LOG_BIN , BLRM_BINLOG_FORMAT, BLRM_BINLOG_ROW_IMAGE simplifying the registration process.
You can use only one state, say BLR_LOG_BIN_DETAILS and then create variables from one saved reply:
char *var1 = blr_extract_column(router->saved_master.selectver, 1);
blr_slave_send_var_value(router, slave, ""@@var1"", var1 == NULL ? """" : var1, BLR_TYPE_STRING);",True,{'THUMBS_UP': ['https://github.com/adaszko']}

router->maxwell_compat should be used for skipping ""SET character_set_results = NULL"" as well.
I would suggest to use router->maxwell_compat to skip all the ""maxwell"" queries.



If possible don't save the output of SET (that should be OK packet without messages) and reply to client with ""blr_slave_send_ok"".

This change fixed the freezing problem.","@svoj, could you be more specific regarding the pitfalls? That's very old code and apparently the while (lock->lock) was added in an attempt to make it more efficient. However, now with volatile in place I think the implementation is correct. But I assume that if that extra busy loop were removed and the unlocking done using __sync_lock_release no volatile would be needed. Is that what you are suggesting with the comment that GCC intrinsics are enough?",True,{}

This change fixed the freezing problem.","Yes, mostly. I will go through spinlock code and post my suggestions there.
In this particular case volatile kind of alright, it disables some compiler optimisations and thus we get fresh value from memory.
The problems with volatile in this case are:

it can be cached by memory controller (both store and load), delaying acquisition
it generates a lot of bus traffic, which is not something we actually want

See also: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7872175/c-volatile-variables-and-cache-memory
Possible solutions:

add compiler memory barrier, which doesn't solve memory controller cache issue
much better to add a delay/yield between test-and-set",True,{}

This change fixed the freezing problem.","Apparently it is impossible to comment source code in github, only commits. So here're issues I found:

atomic_add() - generally these days x86 assembly code for atomic operation is not needed: we removed it from server 10.3, use appropriate atomic built-ins instead; it doesn't have memory barrier argument; it have to issue ""full"" memory barrier, which is overkill for mutex implementation.
calling atomic_add() twice (when mutex is busy) is evil
while (lock->lock) already discussed above
I'd avoid updating lock->waiting when mutex can be acquired immediately for scalability reasons (OTOH this seem to be debug code)
int functions returning TRUE/FASLE are evil
profiling is kind of alright unless it is used in production
spinlock_release() should use __sync_lock_release as discussed above
spinlock_stats() is subject of division by zero on integer overflow",True,{}

firstly, i will test this pr with following case, to measure how much impact with performance:
function event(thread_id)
   db_connect()
    rs = db_query(""select 1;"")
db_disconnect()

secondly, if this pr be accepted, we want go further to impl global threadid since currently client session id is different from server session id, although we have a mapping in mxs, but it not work in a cluster deploy;
our proposal is:


divide session id  into two part,
 |31 - 24| 23 - 0|

|-------|------|
|nodeid | session id|


set this session id back to server


so if worker thread has a session id pool, another bits will be consumed

Background
Since mxs can get many useful info from server side var session track,
but without the feature deprecate eof, we can only get some info from ok packet;
if we can handle deprecate eof, we can get more info from server side;

First mysql_stmt_execute will produce packet with params meta info, but the rest mysql_stmt_executes do not have the same info,  if first mysql_stmt_execute go to server1, and second go to server2, will produce different result; because server2 do not have these meta info will produce unexpected results;

I created a simple test case to reproduce this problem, enable general_log, we can see that 'real query' execute on master and slave are different:
 master general_log: select c1 from test_sub_execute where c1= 8.0
 slave general_log : select c1 from test_sub_execute where c1= NULL

this PR will record n_params to parse flag new-params-bound-flag,

deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0

Security:

The properties __proto__, __defineGetter__, __defineSetter__ and __lookupGetter__
have been added to the list of ""properties that must be enumerable"".
If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent,
it will silently evaluate to undefined. This is done in both the compiled template and the ""lookup""-helper.
This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
published recently.

Compatibility notes:

Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
__proto__, __defineGetter__, __defineSetter__ and __lookupGetter__ in the respect that those expression now return
undefined rather than their actual value from the proto.
The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:

{
  __proto__: 'some string'
}

The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only
increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

 Please don't include this change in this commit, it's not related to
 the issue.

 It seems to be a regression of MXS-2956
 <https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-2956>. If you want, you can
 submit a separate pull request for it and we'll merge it right away.

 Use the same values as defined here:

 <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-maxscale-25-mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide/#ssl_version>

 In addition, the default value should be in the configuration
 parameter enum as it should be possible to explicitly define the
 default value. The default can be added as the |MAX| value as it
 supports the highest available TLS version that both the client and
 the server support.

 Use the |maxbase::ssl_version::Version| enum from |<maxbase/ssl.hh>|,

 Use a |switch| statement and handle all the known cases separately.

 Don't log this, it's not useful for the end user. For developers it's
 probably easier to manually verify by attaching a debugger.
