This PR abstracts the adding of lines of information to the title box (where currently version information is displayed). Using this abstraction a line for CHID is added, along with the GUI, .ini, and Lua controls options for it.

An example of information added dynamically is shown in the script below:

looks good.  before I accept it can you change calls to allocate and free memory to use NewMemory and FREEMEMORY (see examples elsewhere in the code).  You will also need to include MALLOC.h in any routine that uses these NewMemory or FREEMEMORY.  I wrote a set of routines (based upon a reference I can't find now) that sit on top of malloc and free that add some rudimentary error checking.  Besides memory that is requested, NewMemory allocates an extra block of memory it uses to store a ""guard"" byte with a known value.  I also store the name of the routine and location where the allocation occurred..  When smokeview runs in debug mode, and whenever any memory allocation/free operation is performed, all memory blocks are checked to ensure this ""guard"" byte is correct.  If it is not , I assume that a memory overwrite has occurred and I cause smokview to crash.  This feature has saved me many times!  I also have a CheckMemory directive I sprinkle throughout the code to force a checks of memory blocks.  This checking does not occur in release mode so does not affect performance.  (don't really notice any performance issues in debug mode iether).
Looks like you did it correctly but we'll have to be care about screen space adding the extra title lines.
Let me know if you have any questions.",True,{}

I may not be perfectly consistent but one coding convention I try to follow is to use xxxxdata for a structure definition and xxxxinfo for the variable name for that structure (ie can you pick a different name for your variable titledata).  Also, I know I use too many global variables but I try to keep global and local variable names different.  If I had it to over again I would add some prefix to a global variable name to hilight the fact that they are global.  Anyway, when I compiled infoheader.c I get the following warnings.  Could you change the variable names so that they don't clash with global variable names.

I updated the memory allocations to use those macros, looks like an handy feature to have.
I've updated the variable and type names to fit the naming scheme, I was a bit unsure, hopefully this update will suffice. To avoid shadowing the global names in the initialisation function I've appended _string to make it clear it is a string representing that information and to differentiate it from the globals. I've also appended _ptr to the titleinfo for the same reason. I don't know if that was the cleanest way to do it, but I'm striving to avoid globals where I can. Let me know if you have any input.
I've removed VP_title out of the parameters and left it global. It's used globally already anyway, so it's still fairly simple, and still keeps use of globals in those new functions low.",True,{}

This seems to be the minimum amount of changes necessary to allow for multiple different Smokeview cases to be loaded and unloaded.  The purpose of this patch is to determine which parts of  the logic would need to be changed to support this. This patch has been tested to load multiple times and works, but hasn't been tested exhaustively.
The main architectural difference that needs to occur is to distinguish between initialisation procedures that need to occur for Smokeview itself, and initialisations that occur only for a particular case. If app-wide initialisations are run multiple times they result in errors, as they weren't designed to be run multiple times. In this patch these initialisations were moved from the read procedure into the main function, alongside other app-wide initialisation procedures.
For language and unit initialisations this was simple, but cameras were troublesome because of the way the read procedure interacted with the camera list. In this patch the camera list is initialised in the main function along with all the other initialisations, and then specific cameras, include default cameras, are loaded and added to the list as part of the case loading procedure.
This patch also includes two new data structures that are currently fairly empty, by represent this splitting of application initialisation and case initialisation. Notice that the simdata  struct, which is for case data, is created when setting up an new case and is passed to ReadSMV, which takes the smv file and populates this struct. The appdata contains all of the data for the application itself. By doing this we can enforce this application/case division by ensuring that loading the case only affects data in the simdata struct, and the loading of the application doesn't interact the the case data.
The logic should go like this:

Start the application.
Initialise application data such as global variables and data structures.
Parse commandline information.
Initialise GUI.
Read in case data from an .smv file and store it in a new struct.
Assign this case data to be the current data.
Update the GUI to relate to this case.
To load a new case repeat steps 5-7.

There is a single application wide data structure (appdata) that will hold most of the current global variables that define the state of the program. This also contains a field pointing to the currently loaded case.
Simulation cases can be read into data structures (simdata, of which there may be multiple), which can then be loaded as the current simulation (setting the current simulation case in the appdata).
If this makes sense architecturally I will continue to develop it more. It's still at very early stages, I just want to see if this approach is agreeable.","This is more of a discussion piece and this code needn't necessarily be merged.

This seems to be the minimum amount of changes necessary to allow for multiple different Smokeview cases to be loaded and unloaded.  The purpose of this patch is to determine which parts of  the logic would need to be changed to support this. This patch has been tested to load multiple times and works, but hasn't been tested exhaustively.
The main architectural difference that needs to occur is to distinguish between initialisation procedures that need to occur for Smokeview itself, and initialisations that occur only for a particular case. If app-wide initialisations are run multiple times they result in errors, as they weren't designed to be run multiple times. In this patch these initialisations were moved from the read procedure into the main function, alongside other app-wide initialisation procedures.
For language and unit initialisations this was simple, but cameras were troublesome because of the way the read procedure interacted with the camera list. In this patch the camera list is initialised in the main function along with all the other initialisations, and then specific cameras, include default cameras, are loaded and added to the list as part of the case loading procedure.
This patch also includes two new data structures that are currently fairly empty, by represent this splitting of application initialisation and case initialisation. Notice that the simdata  struct, which is for case data, is created when setting up an new case and is passed to ReadSMV, which takes the smv file and populates this struct. The appdata contains all of the data for the application itself. By doing this we can enforce this application/case division by ensuring that loading the case only affects data in the simdata struct, and the loading of the application doesn't interact the the case data.
The logic should go like this:

Start the application.
Initialise application data such as global variables and data structures.
Parse commandline information.
Initialise GUI.
Read in case data from an .smv file and store it in a new struct.
Assign this case data to be the current data.
Update the GUI to relate to this case.
To load a new case repeat steps 5-7.

There is a single application wide data structure (appdata) that will hold most of the current global variables that define the state of the program. This also contains a field pointing to the currently loaded case.
Simulation cases can be read into data structures (simdata, of which there may be multiple), which can then be loaded as the current simulation (setting the current simulation case in the appdata).
If this makes sense architecturally I will continue to develop it more. It's still at very early stages, I just want to see if this approach is agreeable.","Thanks, Glenn. This PR definitely shouldn't be merged, it has known issues. The point was more to determine if the general concept of splitting/moving some of the code was an acceptable approach. Is the complication due to moving the camera initialisation code out? The additional data structures aren't completely necessary to achieve the desired purpose, if anything they were attempting to simplify it.",True,{}

complicated and messy.  I can't afford the risk of making it more so to
where I can't debug it.  Even if complexity was not an issue I don't how
loading multiple cases could work without a redesign of the code.  For
example, the glui dialog box creation routines are case dependent and can
be called only once.  How would you define dialog boxes for the second
case?  would you be able to use smokediff for what you want to do?

    - This is more consistent with the rest of the build system, which

    - The current implementation can result in libraries being built
