More information on the specifics are located here and well as my custom bootstrap build, and some images of the new design.
Caveats:

This phase 1 (personally my 4th complete code rework) is just for showing off possibilities and I am looking for as much feedback as possible. Also need people with screen readers to test to make sure everything works, any problems can be easily fixed.
Device name in sidebar header under logo isn't working, tried pretty darn hard to get it working. Must be something I'm missing.
Some of the very LONG pages like basic.sh, need some more tweaks and code cleanup which is no longer needed. Still would like wifi section on basic.sh to be broken into 3 parts.
Any features used were kept to IE8+ FF3+ All chrome/opera/safari versions for compatibility. Any hidden text will still be read on screen readers. Kept this to only the login screen currently.
Only javascript added was getting the sidebar to open when clicked on mobile, located at the bottom of the gargoyle header footer file.
You CAN flash over this build without having issues on 1.9.x builds. I backed up my settings as a precaution, as I suggest you do the same.
All *.sh/.css files can be modified on the fly on a running router without issues, so if you want to test changes or tweaks, modify away. Most of the *.js can be except common.js, which likes resetting your settings when modified.
I'm hoping to get this merged before or with 2.0.x builds. Sooner the input the sooner the changes can be applied.
theme.css is the primary .css file; any changes to it will override everything else. Thinking themes should have a default 'theme.css' file, possibly even a 'theme.js' since some people need to add custom js.

If you have that working, it would be great if you commit that in a separate pull request, because I would merge that right away.
Second... this doesn't look like it's going to be backwards compatible with existing themes, of which there are many, which concerns me. You over-wrote the page layout for pretty much every page rather than altering CSS that works with the existing layout (or CSS that works with a modified layout and using javascript to modify it dynamically, which would also be perfectly fine and backwards compatible). I won't say no definitively, I might be persuaded, but when you're invalidating every theme that anyone has developed thus far... you need a very compelling reason to switch. What advantages do you feel are worth that in this implementation?
Also, how much space is this going to add (or subtract? maybe you've refactored it so the CSS is way more efficient? That would fall under ""compelling reasons"" above ;-) ) I'm about to drop support for 4M routers, but space is still at a premium.
Regardless of everything else, I do very much like the idea of allowing template files in the theme folder to make things more dynamic.
Finally -- while I don't care what logo you have in your own theme, the Gargoyle logo itself isn't going to change. I would consider changing the color, but the logo itself will always be the same, and will appear in the default theme, whatever it is, no matter what.",True,{}

Travis-ci isnt 100% working and i'll remove it from the pull request. Wasn't my main priority, and was trying to get it working.
I worked on this for 5-6 months, of which 2 months were dedicated to attempting to integrate bootstrap without issue into the current theme. I tried, however, because of the way bootstrap is designed, it would need more work arounds than was worth the time to do. There are 2 major pro's to the bootstrap design, 1. Being as its the most widely used responsive design out there, anyone who can develop a simple theme for your custom original theme, would have the easiest time to modify for this. Literally all the important css is in the theme.css, and overrides anything else. 2. Regardless of the fact that it is responsive, since I stuck to the default Bootstrap class's, ANYONE can easily generate a new theme file using: customizer ; I named mine theme.css but it spits them out as bootstrap.theme.css. Meaning even someone who doesn't know css design can goto that page change a few settings, download the new theme and rename the file and paste it into the Gargoyle theme folder and have a completely different color layout & design without needing to have any experience in html and css.
The size of the /www currently on the router is 1071KB. The size of Gargoyle theme folder is 97.5KB on the router. I believe this is around the same size was before or smaller, cant remember off the top of my head, maybe someone can du -h /www via ssh and let me know. This is with the optimized files + minified bootstrap.css. Some layout files can be modified further to shrink their size, removing unneeded code, specifically the large files (basic.sh comes to mind). From the internal.css and common.css files, I combined many of the same used code so that also saved space.
I was trying to play around with templating the header/footer file but didnt have the time to fully test it, would allow people like me to move the nav from sidebar to top for instance, with simple layout tweaks without having to recompile the whole firmware. Currently, no other Router firmware is modular like this... Would also allow people with the space to install larger themes that contain newer and more complicated js/css files like using morris.js. My main idea would be to make a new theme which supports only IE11+ latest browsers and move away from using js functions to html5, like removing cookies and input checks, html5 combines both to make it easier and faster since things can be cached and threaded to be crunching info in the background. But that's for another time.
Was a suggestion, will remove it and put up a cleaned version of the currently used one. No worries. And thanks for letting me know.

Another idea would be to move the internal.css and common.css to a /css folder within the theme folder since those are needed files keeping the Gargoyle theme folder clean, and adding a /js folder also, again allowing people to add js files, which the theme checks and auto loads if any found. Hmm reminds me of wordpress, maybe a config file within the theme that allows overrides to locations of files or compatibility information or something. I have too many ideas.",True,{}

You CAN flash over this build without having issues on 1.9.x builds. I backed up my settings as a precaution, as I suggest you do the same.
All *.sh/.css files can be modified on the fly on a running router without issues, so if you want to test changes or tweaks, modify away. Most of the *.js can be except common.js, which likes resetting your settings when modified.
I'm hoping to get this merged before or with 2.0.x builds. Sooner the input the sooner the changes can be applied.
theme.css is the primary .css file; any changes to it will override everything else. Thinking themes should have a default 'theme.css' file, possibly even a 'theme.js' since some people need to add custom js.
Yes, technically the sidebar menu is on the right side, and the content is on the left, why? because moving the code around caused it not to display the content on pages. Bootstrap lets you 'switch' columns which is what I am doing to get everything working. A better fix would be to put the sidebar menu before the actual content, but I couldn't get this working.
Some pages generate content via their .js equivalent file, however, I have yet to modify any ,js files outside the table.js file, so some tables and content looks off. These changes are planned, but currently waiting for feedback before I continue.
I have some idea's of making the menu look better since I currently think it looks bland.
There are still comments in the code which I used to debug the sidebar menu, currently just pointers and only can be seen in source
Technically you dont need anything other than the gargoyle package, so if you want to use this on a newer build of gargoyle, just copy folder over.

The tools I used can actually be used on other packages also. I used nodejs(latest v5.x) + uglifyjs2 + uglifycss + https://compressor.io/.
Need to modify the build script to include new steps and update the old stuff. Currently, there is code in the (re)build for compressing the javascript with the no longer updated uglifyjs. Need to upgrade to uglifyjs2. There is no script to compress/minify the .css oddly enough. I manually uploaded the images to compressor.io and replaced them with the compressed versions. Going to move the wait_msg_background to css which will save space also.
The only difference in switches in uglifyjs2 is the input file is before the switches, not after like it is currently and the folder name is uglifyjs2.
Still looking for a way to minify .sh files, not sure if this would work: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9907200/how-to-minify-obfuscate-a-bash-script",True,{}

Yeah, as mentioned ignore the *.js files, I am using Atom.io for editing the code. This works out of the box, recent pull in march so has wrt1900ac tweaks.
You can override any files expect the header/footer file, anything in the gargoyle theme folder, or any *.sh files and will work as advertised. You only need the gargoyle package folder. So what I do is git pull, then replace the gargoyle package folder with one in my pull.

In javascript the semicolons aren't necessary unless the two statements are on the same line. They're optional.

I don't know what the rest of you prefers, I am happy either way and I understand why this packages may not be desirable when there is low Flash space (things like OpenVPN and Tor don't even install in those cases). However I think that some people will want those plugins even in routers with small Flash (because hardware mods allow you to add more Flash and/or USB, and it exists for the majority of these models).",True,{}

Closes #524.","I've updated the ar71xx/default profile, which is already what you would call the default small profile -- this profile is the fallback and it's mostly only 4M routers in here. 8M routers should probably be moved to ar71xx/usb (even if they have no usb port), as the default profile really is now optimized to make 4M routers work. If there are some routers that should be moved over to ar71xx/usb, based on having 8M (even if there is no usb port), please send a pull request for that.
I've added part, but not all of what you suggest here. I'm setting the options you suggest to strip out debugging info, but I'm not going to toggle CONFIG_STRIP_KERNEL_EXPORTS or CONFIG_USE_MKLIBS, which would mean that most if not all packages that you try to install on top of the original build won't work. My preference is not to re-enable miniupnpd and to keep these two options disabled to allow the installation of other packages if desired.
By the way, when comparing profiles you may find the config_diff script located in the dev-utils dir useful. If you run it on two config files it will show you the differences in packages and options enabled, regardless of the original order in the config file (where if you use regular unix diff the order of the options is going to matter and you'll see more differences than may really exist if only the order changes).",True,{}

With the inclusion of this PR, this branch has now addressed issues 1-5 that we discussed on the forum by PM.
Issue 6 (horizontal vs vertical layout) is my next target.

Firstboot i18n page now updated
Menu collapse issue, i have made it collapse at the largest possible size that doesn't adversely affect desktop users.
If a desktop user shrinks their screen just before the cutoff point, and a particularly long menu item (Spectrum Analyser as the active page, for example) is on screen, it will wrap to next line. However unlike before, the text now aligns under itself rather than to the edge of its parent container.
i.e.
     > Spectrum
     Analyser
instead of...
     > Spectrum
Analyser
Vertical menu spacing now more closely resembles original gargoyle
Device name font reduced significantly, and fixed so it actually works (whoops!)
""Router Management Utility"" dropped rather than relocating. Happy to place under the logo if you would prefer?

There is also a handful of additional fixes thrown in there for longstanding issues such as:

Quotas wiping the crontab file
QOS Rule table first item being unmovable
Fix corrupted German translation plugin
Fix incorrect menu structure for spectrum analyser plugin","Eric,

Besides getting the other themes converted, and dealing with horizontal vs vertical layouts, we are now getting very close. Could you please provide any additional commentary?","I see two remaining issues which are related, but they're kind of big: Splitting Controls to two lines, and font size. The motivation for addressing both is the same: the new gui seems to take up significantly more space than the old gui, even splitting things out into columns. On mobile it seems quite good, but now on desktops it seems rather clunky.
Right now, I have to scroll twice as far as before just to scroll down through all the controls in the Connection/Basic wireless section. Before they all fit on one screen. I think part of the issue in making things fit is that the new font size for the labels and controls is larger than it was before, which I don't think is a good idea.
I'd really like to go back to trying to having labels on the left and controls on the right instead of splitting between rows like the new gui is currently doing, at least for how everything is displayed to desktop users. Ideally, on horizontally constrained screens this would wrap, while on larger screens it would remain on the same line. On the status screen the labels and values are on the same line, and this seems like what I think would be best elsewhere as well.
Tonight and tomorrow I'm going to work on updating the formatting and font size of the labels/controls, focusing first on the Connection/Basic section.",True,{}

Make Gargoyle menu system collapsible
Enable collapsible menus on default theme

The previous implementation of the menu system meant that if you clicked one of the major menu items, it would take you to the first item in that sub category e.g. Clicking on Connection took you to Connection->Basic
This new set of changes makes the major headings expand and collapse to reveal their sub-menus. This change is particularly useful on mobile devices where the number of clicks required to get to a particular page was increased.
This has been implemented by making the links into ""dummy anchors"" i.e. ""#"" and the links all return false with their onclick event, meaning the URL never changes to include the dummy anchor, reducing confusion.
If a major heading has zero sub-menus, the old behavour is retained i.e. clicking on it will take you directly to it's linked page. A good example of this is the logout button.
As part of this change i also fixed the tab indentation of the entire file which was previously destroyed, and implemented proper tab indentation of the resulting HTML once passed through haserl. This makes the source code in the browser much easier to navigate.
Unfortunately due to this, the diff is a bit all over the place, so if you would like me to step through the changes in more detail i can arrange this. A good example of the type of change is found at Line 560 of the header_footer file.
Individual themes can turn on and off the collapsing behaviour by including a single (empty) txt file within the theme with the name collapseMenus.txt. This adds minimal (none?) overhead to the theme size.

A demonstration of the new behaviour can be seen here","I like the ability to navigate the menu without actually visiting the link.
However, what I don't like is that the way you've implemented this, (1) you have to click on a section to see what's in it, which means clicking doesn't actually open the section, and thus clicking doesn't do what you would expect and (2) when you do click and open a different section you can't see where you are at that moment anymore. I kind of expect to see the menu indicate what section/page I'm currently at.
One way to fix this might be if I didn't have to click at all, but rather if hovering over the button would expand it, and the menu then returned to the current section after I move the cursor away.
I'm not going to merge this as-is (though I cherry-picked the regdb update), and I'm very open to something like this, just not as-is due to the usabiltiy issues listed above.

Make Gargoyle menu system collapsible
Enable collapsible menus on default theme

The previous implementation of the menu system meant that if you clicked one of the major menu items, it would take you to the first item in that sub category e.g. Clicking on Connection took you to Connection->Basic
This new set of changes makes the major headings expand and collapse to reveal their sub-menus. This change is particularly useful on mobile devices where the number of clicks required to get to a particular page was increased.
This has been implemented by making the links into ""dummy anchors"" i.e. ""#"" and the links all return false with their onclick event, meaning the URL never changes to include the dummy anchor, reducing confusion.
If a major heading has zero sub-menus, the old behavour is retained i.e. clicking on it will take you directly to it's linked page. A good example of this is the logout button.
As part of this change i also fixed the tab indentation of the entire file which was previously destroyed, and implemented proper tab indentation of the resulting HTML once passed through haserl. This makes the source code in the browser much easier to navigate.
Unfortunately due to this, the diff is a bit all over the place, so if you would like me to step through the changes in more detail i can arrange this. A good example of the type of change is found at Line 560 of the header_footer file.
Individual themes can turn on and off the collapsing behaviour by including a single (empty) txt file within the theme with the name collapseMenus.txt. This adds minimal (none?) overhead to the theme size.

A demonstration of the new behaviour can be seen here","Hi @ericpaulbishop
Please see/test the latest changes to this PR.
I have not done a build test, but have tested the code on a live router.
Changes:

Nav elements now have an ID assigned to them making them easier to find/manipulate in functions e.g. ""Status"" is the first major nav item so it is ""nav_MAJ01_MIN00"". ""Overview"" is the first minor nav item under Status so it is ""nav_MAJ01_MIN01"" etc.
On pageload, the nav state for that page is stored in a variable. I don't forsee this being a problem, but if it is it could be coded into the header/footer program itself
If the user moves their mouse away from the menu for > 1.2s, the menu will restore to it's original state. This action is cancelled if the user puts their mouse back onto the menu before the timer lapses.
As discussed, the ""onclick"" behaviour of the menu has now been changed to ""onmouseover"". I don't agree with this change and personally think it feels very clunky. Please spend a bit of time using this particular part and let me know your thoughts. It could maybe be solved by a slow transition applied to the menu, although i couldn't get this to work properly.

Please let me know of any feedback.
@tapper82 the onmouseover events should be ok for a screen reader. I navigated the menu using keyboard only and it operated as i expected.",True,{}

Unfortunately due to this, the diff is a bit all over the place, so if you would like me to step through the changes in more detail i can arrange this. A good example of the type of change is found at Line 560 of the header_footer file.
Individual themes can turn on and off the collapsing behaviour by including a single (empty) txt file within the theme with the name collapseMenus.txt. This adds minimal (none?) overhead to the theme size.
A demonstration of the new behaviour can be seen here",Very cool. Went from a nice to have addition to a big value add.,True,{}

In most cases, it's not necessary to install a switch at the customer.","Hi,
I'm not sure that these patches suit the larger gargoyle audience. They look to be very specific to a few routers, and a few scenarios.
My thoughts:

worried about your removal of the issinglesthernet checks in basic.js. The Gargoyle Pocket Router (when it was in the shop) is a single Ethernet device. Breaking functionality on a device sold by Gargoyle is not good.
your handling of VLAN switch config is not generic. It only applies to those particular devices
multiuser support, while I'm not disinclined to this, the way this one is implemented leaving a large security backdoor is a big no from me
removal of firstboot page means users aren't promoted to set language or change default password
I don't like the idea of having patches to the main gargoyle package. That seems hard to maintain

To me this seems like a very niche patch that would be better implemented in a forked repo by creating a new target and using the target/patches/ structure to apply these at build time",True,{}

I can periodically update the patches in my forked repository.
These patches provide advanced functionality of the standard system. Any functionality or change is exported to a separate patch and described. They are intended for use with custom build. The user can decide which patch wants to use and who does not.
The patches offer users with no experience an easy way to change basic things without losing their own time with a thorough examination of the system.

If you can figure out a way to do this as a plugin, I will reconsider merging it.
I would add that if you find that you can't do it as a plugin due to changes necessary in the basic section (which may be the case), if you can find a way to make it possible to preserve current functionality by default, but allow a plugin to modify certain sections of the basic page I would consider merging those changes to connection/basic.

With this change, the certificate will now be termed as valid by the browser as long as:

the IP of the router running Gargoyle remains to the default 192.168.1.1
the CA is known on client system

Other things that should be done:

 adapt the above command for systems with openssl installed so that in case the default uhttpd.crt and uhttpd.key are deleted, the new auto-generated (through package/gargoyle/files/www/js/access.js#L160-L169) ones are not invalid.
 issue new certificates on IP address change","Some modern browsers like Chrome 58+ no longer matches the Common Name (CN) in certificates and make use of Subject Alternative Names (SAN) instead. Making SAN a mandatory field.
Due to this the previous certificates in use were recognized as invalid with the error net::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID even after manually adding the Certificate Authority (CA) to trusted list.

In this method, the error is dealt with gracefully and the code and continue operating.
For example, we want to assign the SVG (graph) object from the bandwidth_distribution page to a variable so that we can use it. This SVG object takes a long time to load, and so at some early point in time, the object is not necessarily defined. We know this ahead of time, so we ""try"" to assign this object to the variable, and if it errors, we ""catch"" the error. In this case the catch is essentially to wait, and try again.

Closes #691","@ericpaulbishop i'm about to try and tackle #688 next
In order to do this, i'm going to want to revoke certificates (rather than just deleting them).
Have figured out how to do this [1], but i need an intact index file for the certificate database.
We are currently generating the certs/keys in /tmp/randomdir and then removing that dir afterwards, rather than operating at /usr/lib/easy-rsa.
Is there a reason for this? Or is it purely a flash space conscious action?
It may not matter as i may be able to rescue the needed files and store them in /etc/openvpn with everything else and rebuild the folder as required (similar to what is already being done). This will be my next experiment based on your answer.

Buttons created with the BUTTON element function just like buttons created with the INPUT element, but they offer richer rendering possibilities: the BUTTON element may have content. For example, a BUTTON element that contains an image functions like and may resemble an INPUT element whose type is set to “image”, but the BUTTON element type allows content.

Changelog

Switch button element declaration inside JS files from <input type=""button""/> to <button></button>. Advantages described below:


Buttons created with the BUTTON element function just like buttons created with the INPUT element, but they offer richer rendering possibilities: the BUTTON element may have content. For example, a BUTTON element that contains an image functions like and may resemble an INPUT element whose type is set to “image”, but the BUTTON element type allows content.



Update save/close JS buttons CSS classes names of edit pages for consistency with other pages.


Add custom CSS classes names to common button elements (e.g. btn-edit, btn-remove, etc) found in various tables throughout the system.

Adding these custom classes would allow to easily address style changes to a specific button, going from setting a different background/border/hover or even the addition of good-looking icon fonts (e.g. FontAwesome, Noun Project, etc). This could be easily done using only CSS and pseudo-classes.

btn-edit:before

A horizontal menu would be interesting, something like LuCI/OpenWRT?
Speaking of the menu bar, would it be possible to bring the ""collapsible menu"" behavior to Desktop as well? And maybe make that a toggle option inside the UI, so users can decide which one they prefer?
I'm aware that Eric was concerned about the usability issues of this model, but once you get quite used to the interface, one less click/page reload is a bonus, IMO. That's my opinion though, different users, different needs.

Also I’m going to make a change to the code to allow the theme to dictate colours of graphs on bandwidth usage page. This may be of use to you.

That sounds great.
Is it possible to do something similar to change colors within the theme itself? Like selecting a different color palette preset for primary/secondary action buttons maybe?

Yes.

Was attempting to diagnose why packages won't install under 1.11.x. Definitely threw myself into the deep-end.
Couple of options:

Patch MD5Sum's back into the package building process
Patch (properly) gpkg/libbbtargz to support sha256sum

Below patch for both gpkg and libbbtargz are my initial attempts (rather unsuccessfully).
The sha256sum code is borrowed from opkg in openwrt repo.
Problem: SHA256SUM in libbbtargz does not equal what other tools come up with (uh oh)
Bypassing that code for a moment, we then start to run into ""gunzip: invalid magic"" errors. Have not chased these very far yet.
What I haven't tried is rebuilding the whole firmware just to make sure everything is linked correctly. I've just dropped a new libbbtargz library and gpkg binary into the router.
Thoughts? Glaring mistakes?

 Was attempting to diagnose why packages won't install under 1.11.x.
 Definitely threw myself into the deep-end.
 Couple of options:

    1. Patch MD5Sum's back into the package building process
    2. Patch (properly) gpkg/libbbtargz to support sha256sum

 Below patch for both gpkg and libbbtargz are my initial attempts (rather
 unsuccessfully).
 The sha256sum code is borrowed from opkg in openwrt repo.
 Problem: SHA256SUM in libbbtargz does not equal what other tools come up
 with (uh oh)

 Bypassing that code for a moment, we then start to run into ""gunzip:
 invalid magic"" errors. Have not chased these very far yet.

 What I haven't tried is rebuilding the whole firmware just to make sure
 everything is linked correctly. I've just dropped a new libbbtargz library
 and gpkg binary into the router.
 Thoughts? Glaring mistakes?

Allows the user to select the country they are in for regulatory purposes. The default option ensures regulatory compliance in all countries

Through the use of a new tool Gargoyle-IP-Query (leveraged off existing code from ddns_updater), we can attempt to detect the GeoIP location of the user.
The user will be allowed to set a wireless country setting under the following conditions:

A GeoIP location has been successfully detected (requires internet connection)

For this reason, this option is not available at firstboot, but will show up the first time Connection -> Basic is loaded after an internet connection is available


If the country setting has been previously set, it cannot be set again

The user is also presented with a large text block:

Gargoyle has attempted to determine your geographical region. If this is not correct, it is strongly recommended to leave this setting as World (Default).
Setting this value incorrectly may lead to you violating regulatory standards in your region. If in doubt, choose World (Default) which is legal in all regions.
By setting your country correctly, you may be allowed to use additional channels, higher transmit power or wider channel widths.

Devices highlighted in Green have been successfully compiled under the current code base.

I propose that devices labelled Tiny (4mb flash) be removed from the picture entirely.
There's some reasonably popular routers in the USB profile which aren't compiling. I think the kernel is exceeding capacity (rather than the rootfs), as i tried removing openvpn as a default package from USB and got no further. Can either:

Turf these as well
Move them to default and see if they compile?


Are there things that don't need to be in here that have been forgotten or aren't optimised correctly? I admit to not knowing too much in this area. I tried to pull IPV6 out but as you said, we have a few dependencies on it these days. It also seems to be much more tightly integrated into the Kernel.",True,{}

Update ramips/mt7620 profile to Openwrt 18.06.1
Merged usb_mt7620 and usb_mt7620_mt76, since there was virtually no difference left in openwrt 18.06.1. Added mmc support, since some of the routers have micro sd card reader inside, and the packages do not take up much space.

From what I understood it is possible to omit the key direction, which will result in bidirectional use of keys: one HMAC and one for encryption and decryption.


Alternatively is it possible to configure altering values between 0 and 1 on the server and the client. (e.g. on the server 0 and on the client 1, or the other way around). Which causes the use of 4 distinct keys (HMAC-send, cipher-encrypt, HMAC-receive, cipher-decrypt).",True,{}

OpenVPN changed the key-direction parameter so it is now part of tls-auth i.e. tls-auth $file $keydirection

If $keydirection is omitted, bidirectional is used


Gargoyle sets the server to use key-direction 0 here
Gargoyle sets the client to use key-direction 1 here
When generating the single .ovpn file for clients, we interpret the Gargoyle settings and either set it as bidirectional, or as the corresponding 0 or 1 here

So behaviour is solid in my opinion.
HOWEVER, i do not know if the bidirectional symbol is still valid, or whether you omit it entirely in this case. I'm seeing conflicting reports on this.
I implemented it based on the FAQ here",True,{}

I'd normally just push it straight through but it's a bit of a hairy one.

Problem: It appears that once the data in this monitor gets large enough that it can no longer be fetched in a single query, it is failing to do so.
The main cause of this is that the buf which we are sending back into the socket has now been filled with response data which is in a different format.

@ericpaulbishop , i'd appreciate an opinion on this one if you've got some time please.","Seems reasonable. My one comment is that I'm not sure why the ""warp_clock"" behavior was getting triggered given that according to https://linux.die.net/man/2/settimeofday, it gets triggered when the tv arg is NULL, which it wasn't in the original code (it was being loaded from current). If calling it first with 0 tz_minuteswest like you are in the new version, then calling it again demonstrably fixes (or dramatically reduces the prevelance of) the issue that's probably a good solution.",True,{}

@ericpaulbishop , i'd appreciate an opinion on this one if you've got some time please.","Under Linux there are some peculiar ""warp clock"" semantics associated with the settimeofday() system call if on the very first call (after booting) that has a non-NULL tz argument, the tv argument is NULL and the tz_minuteswest field is nonzero. (The tz_dsttime field should be zero for this case.) In such a case it is assumed that the CMOS clock is on local time, and that it has to be incremented by this amount to get UTC system time. No doubt it is a bad idea to use this feature.

Noting the above, this is what the workaround is designed to do. We call it initially with everything zero'd to appease the kernel, and then call it again with the actual update. This should only be necessary on first boot, but we can't reliably tell if this will be the first time it is running on the system.
If we don't provide a timeval (null field) it should neither be updated nor returned so should be ok.
I think i'll merge it in later this week. Unfortunately we only ever get to test this piece of code a couple times a year.",True,{}

If you'd prefer to add an alternative repository as a fallback in the Makefile, this would be acceptable under a new PR against master (see point 4).
If we were to replace the official repo or add an alternative, i'd prefer it was a repository that had a bit more of a trust relationship behind it. I don't know anything about this repository, but i do know that my own is trustworthy (at least to me), and by extension i would hope that the project could place its trust in me also.
We've closed off the base_on_openwrt_remerge branch as it was merged into master, so please base your future contributions on that branch.

I've added GUI support for OpenWrt/hostapd's fast roaming functionality. This feature was already requested in the forum. In contrast to LuCI's fast roaming setup, I tried to keep Gargoyle's GUI very simple, see below. This is possible since OpenWrt simplified a lot like deriving the mobility domain from the SSID or deriving a PMK locally when using a PSK or auto-discovering BSSIDs when using RADIUS in order to exchange a PMK derived from a dedicated pre-shared roaming key.
As far as I understand that means, when a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) is present, a Pairwise Master Key (PMK) can be derived locally without any inter-AP communication and thus no further setup is needed. When no PSK is used (RADIUS), a PMK will be derived from a pre-shared roaming key and exchanged between the APs. This usually requires to list the BSSIDs and NASIDs of all APs which makes the setup complex and error-prone. But OpenWrt/hostapd can also auto-discover these parameters by using wildcard/broadcast BSSIDs which requires us to just specify a pre-shared roaming key. In short, when a PSK is present, fast roaming can just be enabled. When no PSK is present, a pre-shared roaming key must be specified and the GUI's Javascript will take care of assigning the pre-shared roaming key to the r0kh/r1kh option lists.
Initially, only a single field is added to the wireless section at gargoyle.lan/basic.sh to enable fast roaming but only for WPA(2) PSK or WPA(2) RADIUS encryption. The same applies to the guest network except that no WPA(2) RADIUS is offered.
Encryption: None -> Fast Roaming: Not visible

Encryption: WPA2 PSK -> Fast Roaming: Disabled (default)

Encryption: WPA2 PSK -> Fast Roaming: Enabled

Encryption: WPA2 RADIUS -> Fast Roaming: Disabled (default)

Encryption: WPA2 RADIUS -> Fast Roaming: Enabled -> Roaming Key: Empty

Encryption: WPA2 RADIUS -> Fast Roaming: Enabled -> Roaming Key: Random

The OpenWrt documentation states that a roaming key is 128-bit. But since version 2.5 (I think), hostapd uses 256-bit keys, and for backward-compatibility it would derive less secure 256-bit keys from 128-bit keys. So the GUI requires 64 instead of 32 hexadecimal digits.
Open questions:

The fast roaming GUI setup works and I can verify with WiFiAnalyzer (Android) that it is enabled. I see WPA2-PSK+FT and WPA2-EAP+FT but I haven't yet tested if it actually works. The log of hostapd should avoid the 4-way handshakes when fast roaming works. Help needed.
OpenWrt defaults to ft_oder_ds = 1. Does this mean FT-over-Air is disabled or are both enabled? Are there reasons to not enable ft_over_ds?
OpenWrt defaults to pmk_r1_push = 0. I enabled it when using RADIUS. It's supposed to speed things up. Are there drawbacks?
I've added and translated three new language variables, FstTr, FtKey, and HexCh. I think they are fine, but I'm speaking only German and English.
Currently hostapd 2.7 is packed with OpenWrt/Gargoyle. Version 2.9 has some fast roaming improvements.","Hello,

This is possible since OpenWrt simplified a lot like deriving the mobility domain from the SSID or deriving a PMK locally when using a PSK or auto-discovering BSSIDs when using RADIUS in order to exchange a PMK derived from a dedicated pre-shared roaming key.
As far as I understand that means, when a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) is present, a Pairwise Master Key (PMK) can be derived locally without any inter-AP communication and thus no further setup is needed. When no PSK is used (RADIUS), a PMK will be derived from a pre-shared roaming key and exchanged between the APs. This usually requires to list the BSSIDs and NASIDs of all APs which makes the setup complex and error-prone. But OpenWrt/hostapd can also auto-discover these parameters by using wildcard/broadcast BSSIDs which requires us to just specify a pre-shared roaming key. In short, when a PSK is present, fast roaming can just be enabled. When no PSK is present, a pre-shared roaming key must be specified and the GUI's Javascript will take care of assigning the pre-shared roaming key to the r0kh/r1kh option lists.
Initially, only a single field is added to the wireless section at gargoyle.lan/basic.sh to enable fast roaming but only for WPA(2) PSK or WPA(2) RADIUS encryption. The same applies to the guest network except that no WPA(2) RADIUS is offered.

The OpenWrt documentation states that a roaming key is 128-bit. But since version 2.5 (I think), hostapd uses 256-bit keys, and for backward-compatibility it would derive less secure 256-bit keys from 128-bit keys. So the GUI requires 64 instead of 32 hexadecimal digits.
Open questions:

The fast roaming GUI setup works and I can verify with WiFiAnalyzer (Android) that it is enabled. I see WPA2-PSK+FT and WPA2-EAP+FT but I haven't yet tested if it actually works. The log of hostapd should avoid the 4-way handshakes when fast roaming works. Help needed.
OpenWrt defaults to ft_oder_ds = 1. Does this mean FT-over-Air is disabled or are both enabled? Are there reasons to not enable ft_over_ds?
OpenWrt defaults to pmk_r1_push = 0. I enabled it when using RADIUS. It's supposed to speed things up. Are there drawbacks?
I've added and translated three new language variables, FstTr, FtKey, and HexCh. I think they are fine, but I'm speaking only German and English.

1 enables it, 0 disables it. I don't see any reason to disable it.

I've just found an old latency measurement:

non-802-11r: 150ms
802.11r-Over-the-Air: 16ms
802.11r-Over-the-DS: 71ms

This might not be representative but maybe we should consider to offer it as:
Fast Roaming: [Over Air|Over DS|Disabled]
Otherwise, I'm fine with the default.
Update: [ It seems, over-the-ds is just advertised as an AP capability and clients usually prefer it when advertised but could still choose over-the-air. With disabling over-the-ds, one can force clients to use over-the-air only. ]

I've just noticed that almost everyone is enabling it when searching for some information, so I enabled it as well. But I'm fine with the default here, too.

According to this article, Fast Roaming with WPA3 is not (yet) supported:

“Fast Roaming” (802.11r) was left out of the current WPA3-“Standard” (for personal and enterprise networks).

On the other hand the new hostapd.sh seems to support something as FT-SAE. But unless someone has some insights, I would only offer it for WPA2.",True,{}

Initially, only a single field is added to the wireless section at gargoyle.lan/basic.sh to enable fast roaming but only for WPA(2) PSK or WPA(2) RADIUS encryption. The same applies to the guest network except that no WPA(2) RADIUS is offered.

The OpenWrt documentation states that a roaming key is 128-bit. But since version 2.5 (I think), hostapd uses 256-bit keys, and for backward-compatibility it would derive less secure 256-bit keys from 128-bit keys. So the GUI requires 64 instead of 32 hexadecimal digits.
Open questions:

The fast roaming GUI setup works and I can verify with WiFiAnalyzer (Android) that it is enabled. I see WPA2-PSK+FT and WPA2-EAP+FT but I haven't yet tested if it actually works. The log of hostapd should avoid the 4-way handshakes when fast roaming works. Help needed.
OpenWrt defaults to ft_oder_ds = 1. Does this mean FT-over-Air is disabled or are both enabled? Are there reasons to not enable ft_over_ds?
OpenWrt defaults to pmk_r1_push = 0. I enabled it when using RADIUS. It's supposed to speed things up. Are there drawbacks?
I've added and translated three new language variables, FstTr, FtKey, and HexCh. I think they are fine, but I'm speaking only German and English.
Currently hostapd 2.7 is packed with OpenWrt/Gargoyle. Version 2.9 has some fast roaming improvements.","This is included in the 1.12 branch, so an individual can build their own 1.12.x and enjoy this change.

I've added GUI support for OpenWrt/hostapd's fast roaming functionality. This feature was already requested in the forum. In contrast to LuCI's fast roaming setup, I tried to keep Gargoyle's GUI very simple, see below. This is possible since OpenWrt simplified a lot like deriving the mobility domain from the SSID or deriving a PMK locally when using a PSK or auto-discovering BSSIDs when using RADIUS in order to exchange a PMK derived from a dedicated pre-shared roaming key.
As far as I understand that means, when a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) is present, a Pairwise Master Key (PMK) can be derived locally without any inter-AP communication and thus no further setup is needed. When no PSK is used (RADIUS), a PMK will be derived from a pre-shared roaming key and exchanged between the APs. This usually requires to list the BSSIDs and NASIDs of all APs which makes the setup complex and error-prone. But OpenWrt/hostapd can also auto-discover these parameters by using wildcard/broadcast BSSIDs which requires us to just specify a pre-shared roaming key. In short, when a PSK is present, fast roaming can just be enabled. When no PSK is present, a pre-shared roaming key must be specified and the GUI's Javascript will take care of assigning the pre-shared roaming key to the r0kh/r1kh option lists.

Exactly.

Have you tested that this operates as expected? It can't imagine it wouldn't, but the biggest worry is the i18n variables.

Yes, I've build the image with these modifications. So far, I haven't seen any JS error in the browser's web console. The i18n variables should never be touched as they are global, otherwise it would be a bug of the minifier because we haven't enabled the --toplevel option.
The i18n JS files themselves are not processed by do_js_compress(). That would require modifications to the gargoyle_header_footer.c which expects line breaks after each i18n variable. I haven't found how haserl parses the JS files, might be similar. I wanted to estimate what we can additionally save if we would process these files as well. It would be 69 kB:
# modify rebuild.sh to compress every single `*.js` file,
# then compare only i18n/theme/hook files (-not -path '*/www/js/*.js'):
find package/ -path '*.js' -a -not -path '*/www/js/*.js' -print0 | du --files0-from=- -cb

I've opened this PR so that it can start receiving reviews and feedback early.
More work will be pushed to this periodically, and I will let you know when I think it is ready for merge.
Particularly @ericpaulbishop i'd appreciate a thorough review of the netfilter-match-modules. I'm pretty good at writing inefficient code, dereferencing NULL pointers, and other generally awful memory faux pas.
This PR adds IPv6 support to Gargoyle. I've been running this as my main internet gateway for about 3 months now in various stages of completion. Besides when I've been working on it, it has been very stable.
Notable Changes:

netfilter-match-modules

All have been converted to xtables extensions instead of iptables. timerange has been enabled for all xtables. All other modules enabled for iptables and ip6tables only.
I have removed most of the legacy iptables 1.4 shim code (i think the error exit function is still there though, but could be removed)
Liberal use of union ipany which can store either an ipv4 or ipv6 to save space. Generally this means that an accompanying int family travels with the data to keep track of what we are dealing with.
bandwidth: Converted to entirely use of string_map instead of long_map to allow storage of IPv6 addresses without major modification to tree_map.h. 128 bit math is not easily supported so i did not go there. If this needs to be rethought for speed/efficiency, please let me know. Note that i did test sdbm collision with both ipv4 and ipv6 subnets occupying the same space and found no collisions in a basic home network setup, and did not encounter any in a larger test (not conclusive, ran out of RAM during computation lol)
bandwidth: Previously if you created two rules which reference the same ID, the rule would be rejected, but the iptables entry would still be created. Due to ref_count not being incremented, this would lead to a kernel panic once this rule was cleaned up. This behaviour has been changed so that now largely similar rules are rejected, unless one rule is ipv4 and one is ipv6. If the rule is rejected, the iptables entry is also never created. This means that a single ID can have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses stored in its string_map. This saves complexity and memory in creating additional IDs, and also means that quotas can service both IPv4 and IPv6 devices at the same time (combined quotas anyone?)
libiptbwctl: bw_get and bw_set now take an additional parameter of family which is 2 for IPv4 and 10 for IPv6 (AF_INET/NFPROTO_IPV4 and AF_INET6/NFPROTO_IPV6 respectively). This means that bw data from earlier versions of Gargoyle are incompatible, i have not written a conversion module to handle this missing data. This would be relatively trivial (assume any data with no family is IPv4), but i don't think it is needed. Please let me know if you think otherwise.
webmon: Also outputs a new parameter family with same values as above.
conntrack: Also outputs a new parameter family which is either IPv4 or IPv6 in the GUI for filtering purposes
imq loading has been switched to a try/fail/retry method to try and cover the intermittent failure it has. I have not been able to track why it sometimes does not load. The added safety net seems reasonably robust, and in the event of a repeated failure attempts to cleanup after itself. This should hopefully fix the lack of NAT that some users were getting on a failed system, and also qos being up, but not actually working. Fixes #834


DHCP

Default operating mode is IPv6 Stateful mode. This allows us to fully control what addresses are handed out, as opposed to SLAAC which is just a crapshoot. If you want reliable firewall operation (restrictions, quotas etc), this is how it has to be. This does mean that Android devices do not get IPv6 in a Gargoyle network (SLAAC only, nice one Google 👎).
DUID is required to set a Static IPv6, but optional otherwise.
We only set the final 8 characters, and this applies to all prefixes that the router can delegate (GUA and ULA)
Host/IP mappings are now stored in /etc/config/dhcp instead of the old /etc/ethers and /etc/hosts.


Port Forwarding

Port forwarding doesn't make sense in the IPv6 space obviously. What you would instead want to do is open a port for a device. I could not think of a better place for this, so they share the same space as Port Forwarding.


QoS

QoS rules now have the concept of an IP Family associated with the rule. If src or dst style rules are being written, the IP Family must be specifically set (it can't be both). Matches for just ports or protocols can be Family non-specific.


restore_quotas

Now has a dry run mode which instead of running the xtables commands, just prints them to console. Invoked with -p or -P


Restrictions

Similar to QoS, now have an IP Family associated with the rule. If family is ""any"", can't use IP based rules (can still use local MAC Address matching)



TODO:

General: investigate why WAN6 does not always come up on its own. Sometimes needs a kickstart (ifup wan6), sometimes doesn't. May be a missing call somewhere.
General: cleanup tab vs space indentation. Got my editors mixed up and i've caused quite a mess. Any suggestions for cleaning this up without ruining git history much appreciated.
General: cleanup duplicated code (some things could be done better and more efficiently)
General: cleanup use of full format ipv6 addresses. We should prefer canonical where possible. This also means that we compare apples to apples and don't end up considering 2001:db8:: differently to 2001:db8:0000:: etc.
Connection -> Basic: PPPoE untested. Need guinea pigs who are advanced users.
Firewall: More generally support the negative netmask notation for IPv6 to handle dynamic global prefixes from ISPs.

QoS should already support this
bandwidth/quotas need slight modifications to their subnet comparison modules to support this. No plan of attack yet.
Webmon/Weburl probably need similar modifications
Restrictions should be fine out of the box, except for the bits which rely on quotas.
Need to accept the negative subnet notation throughout the GUI (where appropriate)


gargoyle_header_footer: current_lan_ip6 and current_wan_ip6 need to be fixed so they can fetch from UCI as well as just the interface. Tricky part is that these interfaces can have > 1 IP listed in UCI, so we need to bring them in as a list rather than static options. No big deal, just haven't done it yet.

I've opened this PR so that it can start receiving reviews and feedback early.
More work will be pushed to this periodically, and I will let you know when I think it is ready for merge.
Particularly @ericpaulbishop i'd appreciate a thorough review of the netfilter-match-modules. I'm pretty good at writing inefficient code, dereferencing NULL pointers, and other generally awful memory faux pas.
This PR adds IPv6 support to Gargoyle. I've been running this as my main internet gateway for about 3 months now in various stages of completion. Besides when I've been working on it, it has been very stable.
Notable Changes:

netfilter-match-modules

All have been converted to xtables extensions instead of iptables. timerange has been enabled for all xtables. All other modules enabled for iptables and ip6tables only.
I have removed most of the legacy iptables 1.4 shim code (i think the error exit function is still there though, but could be removed)
Liberal use of union ipany which can store either an ipv4 or ipv6 to save space. Generally this means that an accompanying int family travels with the data to keep track of what we are dealing with.
bandwidth: Converted to entirely use of string_map instead of long_map to allow storage of IPv6 addresses without major modification to tree_map.h. 128 bit math is not easily supported so i did not go there. If this needs to be rethought for speed/efficiency, please let me know. Note that i did test sdbm collision with both ipv4 and ipv6 subnets occupying the same space and found no collisions in a basic home network setup, and did not encounter any in a larger test (not conclusive, ran out of RAM during computation lol)
bandwidth: Previously if you created two rules which reference the same ID, the rule would be rejected, but the iptables entry would still be created. Due to ref_count not being incremented, this would lead to a kernel panic once this rule was cleaned up. This behaviour has been changed so that now largely similar rules are rejected, unless one rule is ipv4 and one is ipv6. If the rule is rejected, the iptables entry is also never created. This means that a single ID can have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses stored in its string_map. This saves complexity and memory in creating additional IDs, and also means that quotas can service both IPv4 and IPv6 devices at the same time (combined quotas anyone?)
libiptbwctl: bw_get and bw_set now take an additional parameter of family which is 2 for IPv4 and 10 for IPv6 (AF_INET/NFPROTO_IPV4 and AF_INET6/NFPROTO_IPV6 respectively). This means that bw data from earlier versions of Gargoyle are incompatible, i have not written a conversion module to handle this missing data. This would be relatively trivial (assume any data with no family is IPv4), but i don't think it is needed. Please let me know if you think otherwise.
webmon: Also outputs a new parameter family with same values as above.
conntrack: Also outputs a new parameter family which is either IPv4 or IPv6 in the GUI for filtering purposes
imq loading has been switched to a try/fail/retry method to try and cover the intermittent failure it has. I have not been able to track why it sometimes does not load. The added safety net seems reasonably robust, and in the event of a repeated failure attempts to cleanup after itself. This should hopefully fix the lack of NAT that some users were getting on a failed system, and also qos being up, but not actually working. Fixes #834


DHCP

Default operating mode is IPv6 Stateful mode. This allows us to fully control what addresses are handed out, as opposed to SLAAC which is just a crapshoot. If you want reliable firewall operation (restrictions, quotas etc), this is how it has to be. This does mean that Android devices do not get IPv6 in a Gargoyle network (SLAAC only, nice one Google 👎).
DUID is required to set a Static IPv6, but optional otherwise.
We only set the final 8 characters, and this applies to all prefixes that the router can delegate (GUA and ULA)
Host/IP mappings are now stored in /etc/config/dhcp instead of the old /etc/ethers and /etc/hosts.


Port Forwarding

Port forwarding doesn't make sense in the IPv6 space obviously. What you would instead want to do is open a port for a device. I could not think of a better place for this, so they share the same space as Port Forwarding.


QoS

QoS rules now have the concept of an IP Family associated with the rule. If src or dst style rules are being written, the IP Family must be specifically set (it can't be both). Matches for just ports or protocols can be Family non-specific.


restore_quotas

Now has a dry run mode which instead of running the xtables commands, just prints them to console. Invoked with -p or -P


Restrictions

Similar to QoS, now have an IP Family associated with the rule. If family is ""any"", can't use IP based rules (can still use local MAC Address matching)

I've opened this PR so that it can start receiving reviews and feedback early.
More work will be pushed to this periodically, and I will let you know when I think it is ready for merge.
Particularly @ericpaulbishop i'd appreciate a thorough review of the netfilter-match-modules. I'm pretty good at writing inefficient code, dereferencing NULL pointers, and other generally awful memory faux pas.
This PR adds IPv6 support to Gargoyle. I've been running this as my main internet gateway for about 3 months now in various stages of completion. Besides when I've been working on it, it has been very stable.
Notable Changes:

netfilter-match-modules

All have been converted to xtables extensions instead of iptables. timerange has been enabled for all xtables. All other modules enabled for iptables and ip6tables only.
I have removed most of the legacy iptables 1.4 shim code (i think the error exit function is still there though, but could be removed)
Liberal use of union ipany which can store either an ipv4 or ipv6 to save space. Generally this means that an accompanying int family travels with the data to keep track of what we are dealing with.
bandwidth: Converted to entirely use of string_map instead of long_map to allow storage of IPv6 addresses without major modification to tree_map.h. 128 bit math is not easily supported so i did not go there. If this needs to be rethought for speed/efficiency, please let me know. Note that i did test sdbm collision with both ipv4 and ipv6 subnets occupying the same space and found no collisions in a basic home network setup, and did not encounter any in a larger test (not conclusive, ran out of RAM during computation lol)
bandwidth: Previously if you created two rules which reference the same ID, the rule would be rejected, but the iptables entry would still be created. Due to ref_count not being incremented, this would lead to a kernel panic once this rule was cleaned up. This behaviour has been changed so that now largely similar rules are rejected, unless one rule is ipv4 and one is ipv6. If the rule is rejected, the iptables entry is also never created. This means that a single ID can have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses stored in its string_map. This saves complexity and memory in creating additional IDs, and also means that quotas can service both IPv4 and IPv6 devices at the same time (combined quotas anyone?)
libiptbwctl: bw_get and bw_set now take an additional parameter of family which is 2 for IPv4 and 10 for IPv6 (AF_INET/NFPROTO_IPV4 and AF_INET6/NFPROTO_IPV6 respectively). This means that bw data from earlier versions of Gargoyle are incompatible, i have not written a conversion module to handle this missing data. This would be relatively trivial (assume any data with no family is IPv4), but i don't think it is needed. Please let me know if you think otherwise.
webmon: Also outputs a new parameter family with same values as above.
conntrack: Also outputs a new parameter family which is either IPv4 or IPv6 in the GUI for filtering purposes
imq loading has been switched to a try/fail/retry method to try and cover the intermittent failure it has. I have not been able to track why it sometimes does not load. The added safety net seems reasonably robust, and in the event of a repeated failure attempts to cleanup after itself. This should hopefully fix the lack of NAT that some users were getting on a failed system, and also qos being up, but not actually working. Fixes #834


DHCP

Default operating mode is IPv6 Stateful mode. This allows us to fully control what addresses are handed out, as opposed to SLAAC which is just a crapshoot. If you want reliable firewall operation (restrictions, quotas etc), this is how it has to be. This does mean that Android devices do not get IPv6 in a Gargoyle network (SLAAC only, nice one Google 👎).
DUID is required to set a Static IPv6, but optional otherwise.
We only set the final 8 characters, and this applies to all prefixes that the router can delegate (GUA and ULA)
Host/IP mappings are now stored in /etc/config/dhcp instead of the old /etc/ethers and /etc/hosts.


Port Forwarding

Port forwarding doesn't make sense in the IPv6 space obviously. What you would instead want to do is open a port for a device. I could not think of a better place for this, so they share the same space as Port Forwarding.


QoS

QoS rules now have the concept of an IP Family associated with the rule. If src or dst style rules are being written, the IP Family must be specifically set (it can't be both). Matches for just ports or protocols can be Family non-specific.


restore_quotas

Now has a dry run mode which instead of running the xtables commands, just prints them to console. Invoked with -p or -P


Restrictions

Similar to QoS, now have an IP Family associated with the rule. If family is ""any"", can't use IP based rules (can still use local MAC Address matching)

Now has a dry run mode which instead of running the xtables commands, just prints them to console. Invoked with -p or -P


Restrictions

Similar to QoS, now have an IP Family associated with the rule. If family is ""any"", can't use IP based rules (can still use local MAC Address matching)

I've opened this PR so that it can start receiving reviews and feedback early.
More work will be pushed to this periodically, and I will let you know when I think it is ready for merge.
Particularly @ericpaulbishop i'd appreciate a thorough review of the netfilter-match-modules. I'm pretty good at writing inefficient code, dereferencing NULL pointers, and other generally awful memory faux pas.
This PR adds IPv6 support to Gargoyle. I've been running this as my main internet gateway for about 3 months now in various stages of completion. Besides when I've been working on it, it has been very stable.
Notable Changes:

netfilter-match-modules

All have been converted to xtables extensions instead of iptables. timerange has been enabled for all xtables. All other modules enabled for iptables and ip6tables only.
I have removed most of the legacy iptables 1.4 shim code (i think the error exit function is still there though, but could be removed)
Liberal use of union ipany which can store either an ipv4 or ipv6 to save space. Generally this means that an accompanying int family travels with the data to keep track of what we are dealing with.
bandwidth: Converted to entirely use of string_map instead of long_map to allow storage of IPv6 addresses without major modification to tree_map.h. 128 bit math is not easily supported so i did not go there. If this needs to be rethought for speed/efficiency, please let me know. Note that i did test sdbm collision with both ipv4 and ipv6 subnets occupying the same space and found no collisions in a basic home network setup, and did not encounter any in a larger test (not conclusive, ran out of RAM during computation lol)
bandwidth: Previously if you created two rules which reference the same ID, the rule would be rejected, but the iptables entry would still be created. Due to ref_count not being incremented, this would lead to a kernel panic once this rule was cleaned up. This behaviour has been changed so that now largely similar rules are rejected, unless one rule is ipv4 and one is ipv6. If the rule is rejected, the iptables entry is also never created. This means that a single ID can have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses stored in its string_map. This saves complexity and memory in creating additional IDs, and also means that quotas can service both IPv4 and IPv6 devices at the same time (combined quotas anyone?)
libiptbwctl: bw_get and bw_set now take an additional parameter of family which is 2 for IPv4 and 10 for IPv6 (AF_INET/NFPROTO_IPV4 and AF_INET6/NFPROTO_IPV6 respectively). This means that bw data from earlier versions of Gargoyle are incompatible, i have not written a conversion module to handle this missing data. This would be relatively trivial (assume any data with no family is IPv4), but i don't think it is needed. Please let me know if you think otherwise.
webmon: Also outputs a new parameter family with same values as above.
conntrack: Also outputs a new parameter family which is either IPv4 or IPv6 in the GUI for filtering purposes
imq loading has been switched to a try/fail/retry method to try and cover the intermittent failure it has. I have not been able to track why it sometimes does not load. The added safety net seems reasonably robust, and in the event of a repeated failure attempts to cleanup after itself. This should hopefully fix the lack of NAT that some users were getting on a failed system, and also qos being up, but not actually working. Fixes #834


DHCP

Default operating mode is IPv6 Stateful mode. This allows us to fully control what addresses are handed out, as opposed to SLAAC which is just a crapshoot. If you want reliable firewall operation (restrictions, quotas etc), this is how it has to be. This does mean that Android devices do not get IPv6 in a Gargoyle network (SLAAC only, nice one Google 👎).
DUID is required to set a Static IPv6, but optional otherwise.
We only set the final 8 characters, and this applies to all prefixes that the router can delegate (GUA and ULA)
Host/IP mappings are now stored in /etc/config/dhcp instead of the old /etc/ethers and /etc/hosts.


Port Forwarding

Port forwarding doesn't make sense in the IPv6 space obviously. What you would instead want to do is open a port for a device. I could not think of a better place for this, so they share the same space as Port Forwarding.


QoS

QoS rules now have the concept of an IP Family associated with the rule. If src or dst style rules are being written, the IP Family must be specifically set (it can't be both). Matches for just ports or protocols can be Family non-specific.

Does anyone have any strong objections to me merging this into Master?
Does anyone have any ""show stoppers"" that should be resolved first?
This will allow us to get test versions in more peoples hands and hopefully uncover bugs that i have not thought of.

Fine tune light and green themes. Could be a separate PR like the next commit.
The basic connection page triggered an error when loading the new UCI values directly after successfully saving them. It was accidentally saved as two-dimensional row-column array of a single column. Saving to configuration file still worked but the new value stored in uci/uciOriginal caused resetData to fail.
The JS to determine whether a page is viewed locally or remotely was duplicated in access.js and webcam.js.  Now it is shared as template, supports IPv6 addresses, and is also used in qr_code.js and its login hook 090-qr_code.js.
Since the viewer is included in the plugin page and in the login page it is a template with shared JS and CSS. For this I extended the login hook script to be able to include shared resources configurable via UCI, see saveChanges in qr_code.js.
The editor and viewer use option groups. I put this functionality in common.js.
Functionality for text areas, also put in common.js.
I thought it is a good idea to somehow abbreviate document.getElementById for code size and right drift.

I'm currently undecided regarding option groups. It's possible without them but the viewer selection can get messy with up to three kinds of URLs (local/remote/indirect) which themselves contain all http/https and IPv4/IPv6 combinations. Having two select elements is mostly overkill in cases where only one category/group is offered and requires more user clicks.
It seems quite easy to add WireGuard support. The QR code is simply the text content of a configuration file. And I think it makes only sense to offer QR codes for the list of allowed clients where the public and private keys are managed by Gargoyle. Will give it a try tomorrow.",True,{}

As a bit of history I stole the pr_pack() function from the original
ping() program (circa 1983).

So any unused variables in the function are a relic of that.
