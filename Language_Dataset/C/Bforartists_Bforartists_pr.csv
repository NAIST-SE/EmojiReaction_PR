The iconsheet is killed. No icons in the svg file anymore. But odd descriptions that should not be in the sheet. The size fits, but my inkscape version shows nothing. Just curious, what inkscape version are you using? I have still version 0.9.2 here. Either you have an older version than that, or a newer one.
And it seems that the creation itself went also partially wrong. The png files misses the new icons, which should be up right as i can see from your shot and the code. There is none. Which means you did something wrong at one point. Those png files are intermediate steps. Which must contain the new icons.

One little thing, please don't use overlong names. This one is a bit too long for my flavour: SEQUENCER_RELOAD STRIPS AND ADJUST LENGTH . Yes i know, that's the tool name. But i would've most probably shortened it to SEQ_RELOAD_AND_ADJUST
We could run into a internal number of characters limit when this icon needs to be used in the C code.
Another thing is that i noticed that you use ""inkscape label"" . Nothing wrong with that. That's what the inkscape label is meant for.
I personally simply change the id to the name. Makes the entry shorter, and the list better to read in the xml editor. And you will quickly notice when you have a double in the sheet. Since there can just be one unique id ... . A same label though can exist multiple times.
And you use the name in both in two cases, id and label. One could be cleaned up :)

You don't need to recreate the icons then. The names are just relevant in the inkscape file, for easier navigation. I don't want to have our sheet as messy as the Blender iconsheet.

Wait.. but all of them have labels also, and even misnamed ones.
The ID's currenlty have all the correct names the names, and the Label is the same, as generally the practice I noticed in the file has label as the ID (but with a hashtag).


Is it by putting in the Hashtag that it doesn't show up in the XML? Due to never touching XML in SVG files, I assumed the layer/object in the manager would show it's label (they don't show the ID automatically).
EDIT:

Ah I see, even if you remove the ID in the XML, the ""label"" will still show in the UI (thus all of them have ""labels"", but technically no XML labels) and it will just be the same as the ID but it adds a # sign. In that case, a lot of icons more than my own have labels and wrong ones at that. Maybe this should be another task, clean up XML labels and naming in the icon sheet.",True,{}

Ah, i see you added new lines to the menus in the c files. Could you please next time add a comment there? A hint that this change comes from us? Something like:
/bfa - modified menu, added spaces/

@ReinerBforartists I need some direction at least on where that about window is getting its info. How is this being done for the Windows and Linux versions?","Hmm. Are you sure that you need to add new files?
Blender builds for mac without any new files. And this means Bforartists should already have all required files onboard. Just with a few wrong brandings here and there.

It'll build named as blender.app, not bforartists.app and you'll end up with this weird hybrid. We need our build to use our specific stuff (icons, properties list, etc) and have the correct filename. I suspect the previous person doing the builds did this but didn't add it to the repo, though I'd certainly be interested in hearing exactly how they did it if you're still in contact with them.

The splash image shows Bforartists as it should. This info string appears in Windows and Linux the same way. And should also appear in a Mac build this way.

The screenshots got flipped somehow. The splash screen is correct indeed, it's the about window that's wrong.",True,{}

Our last mac maintainer tried to sell Bforartists in a shop. And we lost contact then since he didn't react to any mail anymore.

The screenshots got flipped somehow. The splash screen is correct indeed, it's the about window that's wrong.

As told, when it's about the string in the splash screen, this string is intended. But i think you mean something different. Do you mean the icon in the taskbar and the tooltip for it?
How old is your branch? I have fixed a icon and name problem yesterday at Linux. Possible that this fixes your problem too.

This patch sets icons for node types so it can be defined once, and accessed in C and Python
I also moved the ugly switch case from node_draw.c :), and soon shall be removed entirely
this is how to get icon from node type after this patch
bpy.types.Node.bl_rna_get_subclass(nodetype).icon
nodetype is for example: ""ShaderNodeAmbientOcclusion""
which the patch uses in node add menu icons
a similar thing was already used for node labels by Blender
bpy.types.Node.bl_rna_get_subclass(nodetype).name
Blender however didn't expose icon, nor did it set icons for nodes, so I had to modify some C files, it wasn't clear at first, but it was worth it at the end
once the icon is set for each type (I reused the switch case we wrote before, for now), and icon property exposed to Python
we can access icons in C or Python
in C we can do this
RNA_struct_ui_icon(node->typeinfo->rna_ext.srna)
which after this patch is used in node headers icons
TODO: define icons in source\blender\nodes\NOD_static_types.h instead of the switch
PS: NOD_static_types.h already has a place for description for each node which we can use for this task #2044
description can be then accessed in NodeItem just like label and icon
bpy.types.Node.bl_rna_get_subclass(self.nodetype).description","Fixes #2043

This patch sets icons for node types so it can be defined once, and accessed in C and Python
I also moved the ugly switch case from node_draw.c :), and soon shall be removed entirely
this is how to get icon from node type after this patch
bpy.types.Node.bl_rna_get_subclass(nodetype).icon
nodetype is for example: ""ShaderNodeAmbientOcclusion""
which the patch uses in node add menu icons
a similar thing was already used for node labels by Blender
bpy.types.Node.bl_rna_get_subclass(nodetype).name
Blender however didn't expose icon, nor did it set icons for nodes, so I had to modify some C files, it wasn't clear at first, but it was worth it at the end
once the icon is set for each type (I reused the switch case we wrote before, for now), and icon property exposed to Python
we can access icons in C or Python
in C we can do this
RNA_struct_ui_icon(node->typeinfo->rna_ext.srna)
which after this patch is used in node headers icons
TODO: define icons in source\blender\nodes\NOD_static_types.h instead of the switch

Looks great so far, but i'm a bit surprised to see another branch here. Seems that i wasn't good enough in explaining, my mistake.
It is not good to create an extra branch for the merge. The sync_blender_master branch is especially meant for just the merges. And the merges must happen in this branch, since this branch gives us a fallback option. Which is gone when we create new branches for every merge and delete them afterwards.
The pipeline is as told, switch to sync_blender_master, merge and resolve the issues from the merge. Commit to sync_blender_master. This part should work for you without the need to make a pull request first. Then do a pull request to merge the sync_blender_master branch into the master. No third branch involved :)
So could you please merge your changes into the sync_blender_master branch first? And from there then into master? :)",True,{}

Mh, i would love to keep the original tools with the HIDE_HEADER opion on, not with the new option to hide just the background. That way the old and new tools are easier to distinguish.
