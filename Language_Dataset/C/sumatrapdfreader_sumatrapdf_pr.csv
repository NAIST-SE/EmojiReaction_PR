I agree that customizing colors and an easy way of switching to other set (like night mode) is valuable, I'm not sold on doing it this way.
I'm very reluctant to add new menu items - we have too many of them already - and the guideline is that a new menu item would have to introduce significant feature that would be used by a lot of users.
I do have ideas on how more functionality could be added without overwhelming the UI for regular use, but there's nothing there yet for a foundation.

Thanks","Hi Blake, thanks for the PR. In general I like it. I admit Sumatra could use visual polish. Here's how I would like to approach this.


I like your icons better than the current one. At this point I don't want to expose it as a preference option (we actually already have a way to replace a toolbar by placing toolbar_11.bmp in the same directory as sumatra.exe). Let's just use new icons. If you could create a separate PR with just that change, that would be great.


For the sake of code simplicity (and long-term maintenance), I don't want to maintain multiple tab shapes. But I also have a preference for a square, simple shape. If you could prepare a separate PR that just changes the shape of the tab to square.


I'm happy to support themes but I don't want to expose them as preferences. Adding preferences  creates a pressure for maintaining future backwards compatibility and at this point we don't yet know if this is the right/full set of settings.


Also, I think a bigger positive impact would come from having 2 (or more) built-in themes that are easy to switch between than giving the user a way to create a theme from scratch.
In concrete terms, I would welcome the following PR:

keep struct Theme
define at least 2 themes (""light"" and ""dark"" are a good start)
add Settings/Theme menu with sub-items ""Light"" and ""Dark"" for switching between themes
More themes are also welcomed (could be e.g. based on Visual Studio Code themes).

For now I would be comfortable telling people that if they want to modify the look they have to edit the code and they could submit the theme for inclusion in Sumatra. That would keep the doors open to having full customizability in settings file in the future.
Implementation comment: currently in Sumatra we have code that tries to select colors of various things based on the Windows color theme (things like win->caption->bgColor in Tabs.cpp). That was a mistake because it complicates the code and sometimes the colors picked are really bad and there's no way for us to test all possible variations). Adding theming is a good opportunity to remove that code (basically remove support for UseSysColors setting and all the conditional code to support it).
In similar vein, there are some other things that are basically superseded by themes, like MainWindowBackground etc. There are probably more color-related settings that should be substituted but probably not all of them (the difficulty here is that we have 3 different uis (fixed page, comic book and ebook ui), which currently have different colors. Not sure if we should simplify and have theme colors apply to all of them, allow for a single theme to specify different colors for each ui or have Settings/Fixed Page Theme/, and Settings/Ebook Theme/  i.e. we have a set of themes but the 2 main UIs can have them chosen separately (comic book ui is so similar to fixed page ui that probably doesn't deserve it's own thing).
Comment on look of tabs: a common complaint is that it's hard to figure out which tab is currently selected. Colors in the screenshots are probably better than what we have currently but I think the best visual hint is when the background color of selected tab ""bleeds"" into the reset of the app, like in Visual Studio Code or Edge.

Finally, I'm sure there are other visual things that could be improved (like appearance of our notifications). I'm happy to merge more improvements.",True,{'HEART': ['https://github.com/orestesgaolin']}

Thanks","Thanks for the feedback!
I have a few questions before implementing those requests:

The icon pack I used (https://material.io/icons/) looks much better with transparency, but obviously I had to modify them to work with the BMP format. I wasn't able to determine whether it is possible to switch to an image format which does support transparency. If you know that it is possible and could point me in the right direction, I'd be happy to implement that before submitting that PR.
I agree the square tabs are quite nice, however I think they would look a lot better if they were sharper. Currently, there is a distinct border surrounding the tabs which seems to be caused by some kind of anti-aliasing. I tried to change the render mode (https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/blob/master/src/Tabs.cpp#L203) but that resulted in nothing being rendered at all. If you could point me in the right direction to fix this I'll do so, otherwise I can just submit a PR as is.
Where should I put the various theme structs (light, dark, etc)? Should I keep the current theme stored in gGlobalPrefs->theme? It seems like that would mean it is still part of the preferences file, but I also do not know how else to save current preferences. I suppose there could be a theme string in gGlobalPrefs which saves the current theme, but then the actual theme struct should be easily accessible from everywhere else, and I do not know where I would store it.
I was trying to figure out if there is a way to change the colours (background and text) of the menus. For a proper dark theme, we would need to change the menus as well, although I understand this may be difficult since you are using the Windows APIs.",True,"{'THUMBS_UP': ['https://github.com/orestesgaolin', 'https://github.com/BOT-Man-JL']}"

Thanks for your reply and adding the feature of remove of highlighting.
There are some problem in using this feature. While I select an area by ""ctrl + left click and drag"", if I highlight this area, it was almost impossible to select it again, so it can't be remove. In addition, when I mark ""abc"", and select ""ab"" press 'h', it will highlight ""ab"" again.

Ops. I have not tested with the Ctrl selection case. In fact, I didn’t know it exists. So, unfortunately, it is out of my ability.
For the second case, yes, only if you select the “abc” again can you remove the highlight.
In my understanding, the code of highlight and selection are different, so linking them needs some work. I think an independent UI is needed like what Adobe’s software do.
Or we can have a short key, such as “Ctrl+Alt”, when holds it and click the area that has highlight, it will be removed. Either way, a design of the feature is needed.
P.S. There are actually some designs, such as

What are your thoughts?","Don't worry about AppVeyor, it does that on every pull request and I don't know why either.
The functionality sounds useful.
Some thoughts:

I don't plan on adding regular expression search. Even I am not a proficient regex user and Sumatra's target users are way less sophisticated in that regard than programmers
making things faster is always good
I'll leave specific comments on the code. Sumatra's code has its own mostly unspoken rules and I want to preserve that
as a heads up: when the code is ready to merge, I'll ask you to squash multiple commits into one
I don't want to add (possibly large) .pdf files to repository. My plan is to put them into sha1-addressable, publicly accessible location and test scripts should download them locally from that well know location. I can take care of uploading the pdf, but tests would need to be extended to take that into account
were .log files meant to be checked in?",True,{}

What are your thoughts?","Thank you for the review.

I don't plan on adding regular expression search...

Pity...

making things faster is always good

Unfortunately, it doesn't give a measurable speedup and makes the code more complex, so I had to drop that idea.

as a heads up: when the code is ready to merge, I'll ask you to squash multiple commits into one

I looked at your comments and thought it was easier to start from a fresh branch and copy things over.  The result should be more or less the same.  Is that OK?

I don't want to add (possibly large) .pdf files to repository. My plan is to put them into sha1-addressable, publicly accessible location

Something like git lfs

were .log files meant to be checked in?

Yes, I wanted to use them as regression cases to make sure I still found at least the same matches as the previous code.  I can maybe encode the same information inside the TestTextSearch.cpp as assertions, which would alleviate the need to diff the log files after the test run to check nothing changed.
Overall, I think your comments on the code are clear to me, so I will start on the changes.

I have successfully compiled the mupdf 1.14.0 with the latest third party libraries, jbig2dec,  freetype2 and harfbuzz.

So,  can link the mupdf library and get the mutool. Now,  the big challenge is to fix all the issues in PdfCreator.cpp and PdfEngine.cpp, because the mupdf interface has changed so much.

Have you begun such work?  Any suggestions?

1. It changes too many unrelated things at once. If something breaks due to those changes, it'll be hard to figure out which change was responsible.
2. Passing by value vs. by reference changes semantics in a subtle way. That means that each change needs to be tested at least by stepping through the code in the debugger to make sure that changed code path have been exercised.
And that needs to be tested by the person making the change because that's the bulk of the work.
3. Most of those codepaths are not in performance sensitive code.
cppcheck is a tool to point out areas of focus but you have to apply judgement on top of that.
Looking at the changes, those that deal with std::function arguments are no-brainer.

extract this loop into a stand-alone function, put it in StrUtil.cpp.
add a few test cases for it in StrUtil_ut.cpp, for both cjk and non-cjk use cases, including a test that would fail with current code.
add a fix

It seems the issue with this code is that iswalnum relies on current locale, which is wrong.
If there's no built-in function that returns the right response, we should write one. It's just checking number ranges. So the current equivalent of iswalnum is roughly:
bool IsCharAlphaNum(c WCHAR) {
  if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') { return true;}
  if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'A') { return true;}
  if (c >= 'z' && c <= 'Z') { return true;}
  return false;

To add CJK support, we would add the case for CJK ranges.

This happens on all supported versions of Windows, from XP through 10.
The cause of this is the well-intentioned but somewhat misguided NoDllHijacking(), which attempts to load comctl32.dll from the system32 directory using SafeLoadLibrary. However, at this point (and in fact, before WinMain is ever reached) comctl32.dll v6.x has long since been loaded. This is because of the explicit DLL dependency declared in the application manifest. You can verify this using a debugger such as WinDbg or x64dbg that stops at the system breakpoint.
Complicating the matter is the fact that comctl32.dll has been declared as a delay-load dependency. This means that the ntdll loader cannot be sure which, if any, additional version(s) of comctl32.dll may be requested at runtime, because it is possible to dynamically activate and deactivate Fusion (SxS) contexts.
So this commit consists of two parts:

Change comctl32.dll from a delay-load dependency to a static import.
Remove comctl32.dll from the list of DLLs to 'preload' (although 'post-load' would actually be a better description in this case 😉)

You may wonder whether this does not open up the possibility of a DLL preloading attack.

I need to think about it.
Part of the appeal of Sumatra is simplicity, which includes trying to be minimal about number of menu items etc.
Given that an alternative is Ctrl-C, Alt-Tab to the browser, Ctrl-V and Enter, I'm not sure if this functionality out-weights the cost of adding additional menu item.

Can I suggest it be left to the user to decide the format of the call (similar to call external editor).
most of that current functionality will suffice.
This is because I uses multiple browsers for multiple functions (none are the default http browser)
so at its simplest there is ability to add a ""prefix"" and ""appendage"" as read from the settings.txt file ?
This could in effect be similar to the current call editor with ""filename"" / ""page number"" just adding  ""content string"" note C was reserved for column but never functional so best to use S or $ for string

Sumatra's philosophy is to keep UI simple and number of settings to minimum. In this case, it either always works this way or never.
However, I don't want double-click on menu icon to trigger this. It's too easy to do accidentally.
Would you be willing to do a little bit more work and implement emulating standard windows behavior by adding sumatra icon before the menu and implement standard behavior on the icon (click to show the system menu, double-click to exit)?
That way Sumatra would behave like standard apps and while in general I want to maximize the amount of space used for content, an icon doesn't take much space.",True,{}

@GitHubRulesOK: Ok, so it does sound like you have some sort of customized setup because I haven't seen the traditional titlebar with app icon to the left in FF for years now. Perchance have you set browser.tabs.drawInTitlebar to false? For me personally that's just a waste of vertical screen space. Might as well use the titlebar for tabs as well. Anyway, if you have the FF icon showing up then of course it'll work the traditional way to bring up the system menu, and to close the app on double-clicking.
If this is replicated in Sumatra then I hope there'll be a way to toggle it in Advanced Settings also for those of us who don't like unnecessary space wastage. In any case I tend to run Sumatra maximized, so for me it's far simpler to just blindly toss the cursor to the top right corner of the screen and click once to close the app. That or good ol' Alt+F4 is far faster and easier any day IMO than seeking out the system menu icon to double-click in order to close the app.",True,{}

Issue: #162","I've managed to have something working, with both double clic to close and drag to move behavior.
I did not use NCHITTEST because the window does not receive it as there is a button (which take mouse event instead).
But that would not allow to implement ""drag to move the window"" anyway.
The solution I've come up does this:

Add a button before the menu button in the caption
React to WM_MOUSEMOVE when left clic is pressed to trigger the move window behavior (#1053 and #423) (Using SendMessage(win->hwndFrame, WM_SYSCOMMAND, SC_MOVE | HTCAPTION, 0);, I trigger the exact same behavior as when the title bar is dragged (including move to screen top to maximize and so on)
React to WM_LBUTTONUP (which is send to the button only when not having dragged the window) to display the GetUpdatedSystemMenu
React to WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK to close the main window
Draw the main window icon in the new button as would do Windows (I've tested high DPI settings and it works fine)

Need some more testing tomorrow and I will be able to push that code soon.",True,{}

Good to know.

Also, I'm not sure if I want to update icons. Maybe just the file association icons.

I understand the concern which is why I updated the icon to be quite similar to the original including all the same text and very close in color.  I essentially moved to top left to the bottom right in order to make it appear like multiple pages behind the icon in order to give it a real material look and to give more instant recognition to people who could be new to Sumatra and what it does. However since it literally has PDF in the icon, I doubt that is a concern over all.

I dont find the historic registry ""auto detections"" as useful as they may once have been, especially as in my case Acrobat, eXchange Foxit etc are all portable apps as are my Firefox Opera Chrome etc.
The stock search invocation of Internet explorer and Edge can be easily found at given locations using
""C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"" ""%2""
""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe"" ""%2""
What varies considerably is the user preference for a target of google, ""bing translate"", ""websters dictionary"" and those need to be set by the user.
Those could be added as defaults but many users have their own preferences so for PDF I currently use the common
\Apps\PDF\Adobe\Reader\AcroRd32.exe"" /A page=%p ""%1""
\Apps\PDF\FoxitReader\FoxitReader.exe /A page=%p ""%1""
\Apps\PDF\PDFXEdit8\PDFXEdit.exe /A page=%p ""%1""
For browser display thats
""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe"" file://""%1#page=%p""
but for searching bing
""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe"" ""string with spaces"" would be very simple and for other apps %2 without quotes would also be great but I do agree it could be potentially dangerous without cheking first for a valid exe as at present.",True,{}

I am unclear as to how this affects non tabbed usage OR TWO instances
a)in terms of wording
b) functionality e.g. is an extra test required for 2 windows and flushing session data on trigger
for reference
FULLY closes duplicated requests #562
Partially addresses #496 #656
If slightly modified to ALL BUT it would primarily address open request #388
Actually without wishing to delay this PR I can foresee the consequential request is likely;y to be
""can I have a toggle to NOT close current , only other tabs,
Often comments mix 50/50 desire to ""Work like Notepad++ or a browser"" i.e. ""Close all but this"" e.g. https://forum.sumatrapdfreader.org/t/how-to-close-all-tabs-with-one-click/1102/4
Thus to keep this more widely acceptable can it be modified to ""Close All Other Tabs"" i.e. retain active window, then the user can close the active one if required by a simple repeat without shift so ALL becomes
CTRL SHIFT W  followed by CTRL  W
or ALT F T followed by ALT  F  C
I am also reminded that mouse middle click is also close current tab
HOWEVER shifted middle click could be too easily UNWANTED for close ALL BUT current see #880
So any Mouse Button function may best be held back for tabs right click context",True,{}

It makes opening and use in non-continuous mode faster.
However, switching to continuous mode pays the price for that and in a blocking fashion, which is not good experience. Especially on slow drives (I'm testing on a network drive, where it can take seconds to load and decompress the whole file).
It could be improved for continuous case.
For example, on cbx open we could kick off a thread to load & decompress images to get their dimensions and cache them on Engine. We don't have to decompress the whole file, the first 1 kb would be enough.
That way, by the time we need the information, it might already be there.
Still wouldn't help the case when we open in non-continuous mode, as we would need this info right away.
To help with that we could cache mediabox and contentbox in per-file settings, which would speed up opening a file the second time. That could speed up opening of other formats as well.",True,{}

Here's how it looks after these changes:


This isn't a trivial operation; we can't just count characters and split the string when we reach a threshold. Different characters have different widths, some glyphs are composed of multiple characters. So it's best to offload this work to the system itself.

It's simpler to implement and would make it easier to implement a better way to truncate strings by removing characters from the middle.
I think it's better to show the beginning and end of string (including extension) than cut off the end.
I.e. ""very long name.pdf"" would be truncated as ""very...name.pdf"" and not ""very lon..."" (of course the max length would be much longer, say 32 characters.

I think limiting the string by character count is better.

It's definitely a possibility; I'd seen this SO answer stating that UTF-8 was built with this in mind, and makes it easy to check if you're splitting a character in half or not. There were a couple reasons I went for the other approach, though:

Wide characters can make the list look very jagged. A file name with thin characters can ends up significantly smaller than one with wide characters. For example, 'i's and 'W's in the screenshot below. The bounding rectangle does not have this issue.
Some characters are made up of multiple codepoints (e.g. emojis come to mind, but possibly also chars in other scrips). When splitting by a fixed threshold, they can end up broken. For example, file (7) below should end with a '👉', but ends with a tofu instead. Using the system's own DrawText() to truncate text fixes this.

These are set to truncate at 60 chars:



Have you checked how other programs on Windows (e.g. Notepad++ or Adobe Reader) handle this?

That's a great idea! It didn't occur to me.
Notepad++ and Sublime Text 3 don't seem to truncate filenames at all 🥴
Visual Studio does what you suggested: they add an ellipsis in the middle of the file name. It also seems like it's generating a tofu for file (2), however their list is not as jagged; there has to be some sort of bounding box at play here:

Didn't check Adobe Reader because I'm in a bit of a rush at the moment, but I could try looking for more examples in the wild tomorrow to get a feel of the industry standard on this.
Either way, I support the simpler idea, or perhaps a best-of-both-worlds approach. Eager to hear your input on it :)",True,{}

The simple implementation is to cut WCHAR characters from the middle.
It's true that some glyphs are represented as 2 WCHAR characters and cutting just one of them would generate imperfect text but that would be very rare. I'm not even sure if such characters are allowed in file names.

2 notes:

it doesn't work for drag&drop (I think because we switch to each new tab)
we should clear background when switching to a not-yet-loaded tab. When a document takes a long time to load (can happen with e.g. complex mobi / epub files), we show the stale image, which is confusing

I agree about async loading.
Shouldn't be that hard: I think it can be done by:

split LoadDocument into two parts:

LoadDocument and e.g. LoadDocumentRest


in LoadDocument

show a notification Loading ${filePath}
on a thread do CreateControllerForEngine()\CreateControllerForFile() (move this work from the middle of LoadDocument to be the first thing
when loading fails, show Loading failed notification
if loading ok, use uitask::Post() to schedule running remaining of the code (i.e. LoadDocumentRest) on ui thread",True,{}
