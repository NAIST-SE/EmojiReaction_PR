But the whole systemd project (including libsystemd.so) doesn't even compile against anything but glibc, in particular the musl c library, without numerous patches (none of which seem to be going to be accepted upstream by either party). Given embedded devices often use something else than glibc, it'd be a shame if swupd locked itself out by depending on it. I realise this place here is probably not the right to have an architectural discussion like this, and swupd is (mainly / only?) targeting Clearlinux with its own use-cases, and swupd shouldn't be limited because some other, unrelated use-case might break, but swupd seemed like a good choice for system updates of embedded devices so far.

curl called resume is activated no matter what,
however although major http server support 'Range'
command that enables this functionality, not all
complies with this, when swupd client tries to
re-download a partial file from one of the server
that does not support 'Range' it will just throw
an error and stop to work until partial download
is deleted by hand.
This patch address that issue by checking first
whether server supports 'Range' command and if not
then disable 'resume' of packs.

Signed-off-by: Joshua Lock joshua.g.lock@intel.com","@tmarcu Because the configure.ac has been heavily revised since this patch was submitted, a rewrite is required.
I would suggest that the following defaults be configurable:

STATE_DIR
LOCK_DIR
BUNDLES_DIR
UPDATE_CA_CERTS_PATH
MOTD_FILE

Making the above configurable will aid cross-distro adoption, because the filesystem layout/conventions may be different. And the default BUNDLES_DIR and UPDATE_CA_CERTS_PATH are Clear Linux oriented, so it would be nice to configure those too.",True,{}

error messages if the verification fails the first time, because we
""retry"" by downloading the fresh copy. If the verification fails the
second time, then error messages are printed. Also, I consolidated the
cleanup logic in this function to reduce duplication.

output of swupd --help. It wasn't being used (e.g. the completion
didn't have bundle-list in it).
Restructure the completion script to use a case statement to list the
valid completion options. IMHO this makes the code easier to
understand.
Add in package name completion for bundle-add. This requires
/var/lib/swupd/XXXXX/Manifest.MoM to exist (where XXXXX is the
contents of /var/lib/swupd/version), be in the correct format
etc.
Add in package name completion for bundle-remove. This uses the
contents of /usr/share/clear/bundles to get the list of installed
bundles. It would be nice to use $(swupd bundle-list) but it aborts if

1)      The script which does the generation has to be updated. This negates some of the advantage of automatic generation.

2)      You get completion of options which you no longer want, e.g. ‘-l’ to ‘bundle-add’.

If you don’t generate the script, there is no need to add code to do the automation of the generation.

@albertomurillo Thanks for the PR, but this won't work for various reasons.
Specifically, we HAVE to re-exec swupd instead of just recursing or using the same process. If we go through a format bump, swupd could have undergone a breaking change and the current running process may not be able to read manifests part of the new format. The certificate could have also changed in which case the running swupd will not be able to update and verify the new MoM.
I think this approach could work if instead of re-cursing, we re-exec'd at the end point so the newly installed swupd will be used,and it will be able to handle all of the above problems. Otherwise we would be running swupd from a version older than the one we updated to.
We can also only re-exec if the update was successful, otherwise we cannot guarantee the new swupd was installed correctly.",True,{}

Then remove them and add a --enable-manpages configure option as
@aaronovz1 suggested. However, then configure should check for the
presence of rst2man.py when enabled (better fail early instead of

Solution: use the release tarballs instead.
I don't support changing the way we do this.

However, if we are trying to support multiple OSes, then we should implement the more pedantic version of verifytime, as seen in the comment on verifytime.c. The current state was an initial fix that works for Clear, however the intended implementation is to not check any file (like versionstamp) and instead query some nameservers or such to get a real time, and use those times to get an accurate system time. That removes the dependency on any file, and keeps verifytime as the short circuit, which it was intended to be.

 Why fail here if picky_whitelist is set?
Because then memory would be leaked. Earlier I had code there that did
a regfree(), but as that code never would be executed now, I removed it
and replaced it with the assert().
  You only call compile_whitelist at one point so I don't see how it
 could be set.
That's exactly the point of an assert: verify that an assumption is
correct.

As you said, the function only gets called once and thus
picky_whitelist should be NULL. The assert() documents that and (at

That would be a good improvement for the future. Let's open an issue. #388

I think that there should be an indication if the results are truncated at 5 or if that is all there is.
I think that we should have the existing ability to list all the matches, rather than just limiting it to at most 5 matches in at most 5 bundles.

How about a flag like --all-results that will display all the results, maybe the way they used to be displayed so that a machine can parse it better?

I look forward to reading the documentation explaining the reasoning behind the scoring rules.

For now these are just experimental heuristics that can be updated over time. I'll add comments with the reasoning behind them as relayed by @fenrus75",True,{}

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables bsdiff_CFLAGS
and bsdiff_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.

Makes sense to me. I have removed all options that are global so only -m, --manifest and -x, --force are effectively added to the man page.

1) Only for Mom and packs, but never use the mirror for fullfiles; full
files are our safety fallback.
  (We can debate the MoM since the MoM is tiny AND security sensitive.
Actually I think I prefer the MoM and signature to not come from the
mirror. so mirror is only for packs)
2) Once we get a 404, we should retry the non-mirror URL
3) If the non-mirror URL then succeeds, when should from then on no longer
use the mirror
4) if we get a hash mismatch anywhere, we must stop using the mirror (e.g.
assume compromised mirror)

Mirrors get stale at times, and we must survive even in the light of a
stale or malicious mirror

So let us consider someone who has 1000 machines to update behind a low bandwidth external connection.

Why shouldn't mirrors be used for fullfiles? The hash check still protects the content.
The fact that a mirror is missing one file doesn't mean that it is not still useful for other files.
If we get something from the non-mirror, this doesn't imply that that we want all 1000 machines all getting everything via the slow link.
Obviously we shouldn't use anything with a hash mismatch. But one file being wrong (perhaps the mirror was being updated and the file was not being changed atomically) does not invalidate all the other files.",True,{}

(I'm kind of late on this one, so let me know if its better to create a new thread to discuss this)
I'd suggest the configuration allow us to specify mirror(s) for specific URLs, instead of a general mirror that will apply always. So instead of having a file:
# /etc/swupd/mirror_contenturl
https://example.com/clear-mirror/

I'd prefer having a file that sort of looked like:
# /etc/swupd/mirrors
https://cdn.download.clearlinux.org/update/ -> https://example.com/clear-mirror/

As a consequence, not extra file is needed for the versionurl, as it can be specified in another line.
# /etc/swupd/mirrors
https://cdn.download.clearlinux.org/update/ -> https://example.com/clear-mirror/
https://download.clearlinux.org/update/ -> https://example.com/clear-mirror/

The main advantage would be: if I move to a mix (and back), I don't need to get the /etc/swupd/ files out of the way.",True,{}

This does not, and is not intended to, fix the overall issue of messy mixer integration. We need a way to allow users to get back to upstream and I think this is the fastest way to do it.

Also, my idea is that we no longer need to add each test individually to the Makefile, that seems like a lot of work for something that is not necessary, we can just run something like ""bats /my/dir/with/tests"" and bats should be able to discover all the tests in that path by itself.

Hmm, are you sure it is downloading the full manifest of bundles that had a valid iterative manifest?
server_manifest.manifests at that point only contains the iterative manifests (for those bundles that had a valid one), plus full manifests for bundles that didn't, so when looking for the bundle in the Mom it will find the iterative manifest. I don't see why it would get the full manifest (unless the iterative was not there or was invalid, for example from a ""from version"" that didn't match).",True,{}

Closes #558","@otaviobp @matthewrsj @jwakre , the PR is again ready to be reviewed. I think I have addressed all your comments.
To make it easier to review, these are the steps followed by the update:

Loads the current MoM, it loads only the full manifests contained in the MoM.
Loads the server MoM, it loads all manifests (iterative and full) contained in the MoM.
Consolidate the list of manifests in the server MoM to remove duplicated manifests, so there is only one manifest per bundle. If there is an iterative manifest for a bundle, and the bundle is already installed, and the iterative manifest is from the correct ""from"" version, it keeps that iterative manifest in the consolidated list and drops the full manifest. If no valid iterative manifest is found, it saves the full manifest in the list instead.
Link all the iterative manifests with its related full manifest using its full_manifest member.
Create a new subscription list (update_subs) that contains only the subscribed bundles that need to be updated.
Add all the included bundles to that list of subscriptions, so the list now have all the subscribed bundles that need to be updated plus all the unsubscribed bundles that need to be installed (if any).
Filter the list of manifests in the current MoM using the update_subs list so we only keep the from manifests that will be used for the update.
Filter the list of manifests in the server MoM using the update_subs list so we only keep the to manifests that will be used for the update.
Download the from and to manifests based on the new lists that only contain the bundles to be updated and/or added. If an iterative manifest fails to be downloaded, the full manifest is downloaded instead.
The rest of the update process remains unchanged...",True,{}

Well, if the test is attempting to test that, then it is correct. However, I'm still not sure that is the purpose of the test. Consider this:

There are many other tests (in the old tests) that don't have zero packs, so this would be a duplicate.

Duplicated verification in tests is not a bad thing. With a test that is intended to explicitly check fullfile fallback for bundle-add we can be sure we won't lose coverage if we update the other tests and add zero packs for an unrelated reason.

The description of the test says this: ""bundle-add verify_fix_path support"", which suggests that the test is validating the verify_fix_path function

You are right, with the official fallback in-place to use full-files for bundle-add this function is probably not being used any more. Think of this more as a functional test instead of a unit test. We need to make sure that bundle-add properly falls back to downloading full-files if there is a missing zero pack. I don't really care which internal function is called as long as we can validate the fallback is happening.

I think you may be mistaken about this test, I believe this test is intended to validate that bundle-add uses the verify_fix_path function here
...
to create the missing directories so the file in the manifest can be added. This test looks fine.

No, verify_fix_path was the fallback function to add any files missing after downloading packs. If you look at the bottom of that test it is checking both a directory and a file that needed to be there after the bundle-add.
I still believe that the first test is explicit validation that bundle-add works with no zero pack and the second test is explicit validation that bundle-add works with incomplete zero packs. The comments and test names are out of date and should be updated though. We do not need to validate the specific internal function, we just need to validate the functionality.",True,{'THUMBS_UP': ['https://github.com/castulo']}

Closes #561","A note on minversion bumps:
13:59 < mrsj> the only time a file will get an updated version number with no hash or content change or file name change is when you have a minversion update
14:00 < mrsj> which raises an issue...
14:00 < mrsj> our current plan will cause ALL OS files to be downloaded for a minversion update
14:00 < mrsj> because a minversion marks all files with a new version
14:00 < mrsj> :/
14:01 < mrsj> so our plan would put those under Case1, where the file is greater than the current OS version
14:01 < mrsj> so for every tracked file you will be adding those to the manifest
14:01 < mrsj> CURRENTLY...
14:01 < mrsj> in manifest.c,
14:01 < mrsj> we can detect minversion updates because we know the file version changed by the hash and flags stayed the same
14:01 < mrsj> can't do that when we aren't using the old manifests any more
14:02 < mrsj> we need another solution
14:02 < mrsj> one solution:
14:02 < mrsj> add a manifest header field to the MoM
14:02 < mrsj> minversion:\t<minversion>
14:02 < mrsj> and if <minversion> is greater than current OS version we do the fallback to verifying all files with versions greater than our own OS version
14:03 < mrsj> make sense jwakre, otaviobp?
14:03 < mrsj> this is unfortunate
14:03 < mrsj> but we should be able to add a minversion field to the MoM in mixer without requiring a format bump for the client
14:03 < mrsj> because swupd ignores header fields it doesn't know about
14:04 < jwakre> What is a minversion?
14:05 < mrsj> a minversion is when all content is ""updated"" on the server-side
14:05 < mrsj> by mixer
14:05 < otaviobp> mrsj: this sounds correct to me
14:05 < mrsj> so all file versions are updated to that ""minversion"" build regardless of whether they actually physically changed or not
14:06 < jwakre> oh, so a minimum version for all files on the system
14:06 < mrsj> right now in manifest.c (search for ""minversion"") the client falls back to verifying all files in the update against the system
14:06 < otaviobp> gtkramer said they usually do it once a mounth, so it's releavant to be optimized for that
14:06 < mrsj> to prevent having to download the ENTIRE OS
14:06 < otaviobp> I thought that this was a rare thing, but it's not
14:06 < mrsj> no it is often
14:06 < mrsj> because it allows devops to free up space on their builder
14:06 < mrsj> :/
14:06 < mrsj> apparently disk space is not cheap
14:06 < otaviobp> disk isn't that cheap, apparently 
14:07 < mrsj> despite what everyone tells us ;P

My understanding is that the +10 and +20 should have identical content, but only the +20 should have a minversion update.

Fine with me, it was requested to be part of the info command which is why I put it there. I agree with you that it makes more sense under --version which is why I added it there as well. Since you agree it makes more sense there I'll just take it out of info.

And btw, ""swupd mirror"" is already displaying all information in ""swupd info"", so can't we get rit of info command? I couldn't find any open issues proposing anything else to be added to that command.

Eh, I like having a swupd info command that gives info. It probably wouldn't make sense to require users not on a mirror to call the swupd mirror command to see their system.

We are using bats for testing and only bash is supported, so I don't see a reason on being concerned about that.

I think a better implementation would use a ""magic comment"" to mark things that should be ignored.

Anyway, I think it's a better idea to use a magic comment. But instead of a comment for ignore I would add a comment for listing it. You could have
 foo() { #swupd_function

and
assert_bla() { #swupd_assert

and grep for that comment.

I wonder if the sorts are a good idea. The fact that you are splitting function names which contain ""assert"" apart suggests that a pure sorted list is not exactly what is needed.

We need a fix for that. If the setup is failing the test should fail. This is a big problem. if it's not an easy fix, open an issue for that.

So after further debugging this, I found out that the problem is actually not because there was an error in the setup method.... but the real problem was with the teardown method.
Looks like this is the current behavior in BATS; if something causes the test execution to exit during setup or during the test body, the test shows as failed correctly, but if exit occurs during teardown then the test shows no result.
For example, this case:
#!/usr/bin/env bats

setup() {
	exit 1
}

teardown() {
	echo ""teardown""
}


@test ""some test"" {
	exit 1
}

Running the test above will yield the correct result:
✗ some test
1 test, 1 failure
Now, consider this other one:
#!/usr/bin/env bats

setup() {
	exit 1
}

teardown() {
	exit 1
}

@test ""some test"" {
	exit 1
}

The test above will yield to an incorrect inconclusive result:
some test
1 test, 0 failures
It doesn't pass but it doesn't fail either.
The misbehaving verify tests where using a wrong option when creating the test environment, which would cause the create_test_environment function to fail, and issue an exit 1, which should be fine,  but then the tests were running their teardown function which was attempting to destroy the test environment using the destroy_test_environment function using a non existing environment as parameter, this was causing this function to trigger an exit 1 which would cause the inconclusive test result.

Every test should include a unique ID, so it is necessary to have
a way of knowing what is the next available ID for the group of
tests.
This commit helps with that issue by implementing the following
features in the test library:

Adds the function get_test_list which can be used to print a list of tests in a specific group directory.
Adds the function get_next_available_id which return the next test ID that can be used in a new test.
When using the generate_test function to generate an empty test the next available ID will be used for the template.

This commit also adds the ID to a bundle-add test that was missing it.

But I prefer to add a function to testlib that print that as output instead of committing the test file. And you could print just one output instead of one per file, like:

So this pull request consolidate parameters in global.c and fixes some sanitization problems I found.
Note that we have a problem related to weird path names (#640) but this isn't a sanitization problem because that path is valid.
Fixes: #571",I pushed the sanitize commit back because I realized I could do it in this PR. It will get better after #722.,True,{}

When curl checks the connection at curl initialization it does a HEAD request to that server, and that TestServer does not support that method so it returns a code 501. Since we have set CURLOPT_FAILONERROR with the swupd_curl_set_basic_options which does this ""CURLOPT_FAILONERROR - request failure on HTTP response >= 400"" then curl initialization fails.
To fix this test I'll need to either add support to HEAD requests to the TestServer class, or move the functionality from the TestServer class to the SimpleServer class which supports the HEAD method and get rid of TestServer.

Always separate codes that contain multiple words using an underscore SWUPD_MULTI_WORD_ERROR instead of using SWUPDMULTIWORDERROR

Internally, swupd can use errors that comply with these rules:
it can use errors defined in any included file as long as these don’t get propagated to the end user. For example errors from:

/usr/include/asm-generic/errno-base.h
/usr/include/asm-generic/errno.h
/usr/include/curl/curl.h

Introducing in this commit a suggestion of a new progress bar. It's not printing the total download size, speed or any other download information, but that's something easier to extend now.
So far the only thing that was replaced to use the new progress bar was the pack downloads, because I am waiting on feedback before porting all print_progress we have in swupd.
Example of output on swupd update:
Update started.
Preparing to update from 27460 to 27490

If we are redirecting stderr to a file one progress bar will be printed each time we complete 10% of the progress, so only 11 lines will be printed. The output is human readable and easy to parse. (we can add an option to print on every step if that output is going to be used by the installer to give users feedback)

tests if the static analysis and unit test passed. This is important

It balances the tests run in each one of the four test jobs so they
take approximately the same time. Before tests were being balanced per
test directory, with this commit tests are now balanced at a test file
level, which provides an even better tuning. In this case we are
splitting the update tests into 2 jobs since they are the most time
consuming.


Instead of using bats directly for running tests, this commit uses
""make check"" to run the tests but it provides a specific list for make
to override the default list so it doesn't run all tests. The advantage
of this is to still enjoy the benefits of the nice output provided by
make check which only shows a list of the tests executed and their status
and it only shows the the test output from the tests that failed. This
also provides one more benefit, the ability to use the parallelization
provided by make, so in this way we can have multiple parallelization by
having parallel threads within parallel jobs.

Closes #877","Overall it looks great. I added some minor comments and I have another suggestion.
When we finish the download we print a 100% progress, but we still need to extract the last tarball. So the progress get stuck in 100% for some time. And that's a problem hard to fix, but there's an easy workaround. Can we move progress until 99% and only print 100% at the end of the process?

Well the percentage we are showing is strictly related to download progress, so it doesn't really reflect any progress in tarball extraction, so moving the percentage based on that it would be misleading and that was the problem we wanted to fix in the first place. To avoid being misleading maybe we can just show a message like ""Finishing package extraction..."" after the 100% has been reached, so the user knows download is complete but tars are still being unpacked. The unpacking only take a few extra seconds anyway (at least in all the tests I ran) so users shouldn't really need detailed progress update on that task.",True,{}

Adds a line break to the progress percentage when it reaches 100% so it doesn't has to be specified individually every time a progress is reported.
Splits the action of ""diagnosing"" a system in three actions so the progress is reported more accurately.
Fixes the display of progress percentages when the progress display is ""interrupted"" by another message (look at the example below).

Adds a line break to the progress percentage when it reaches 100% so it doesn't has to be specified individually every time a progress is reported.
Splits the action of ""diagnosing"" a system in three actions so the progress is reported more accurately.
Fixes the display of progress percentages when the progress display is ""interrupted"" by another message (look at the example below).

functionality. In some cases users may want to include a flag with every
swupd command they run.
This commit gives the ability to provide swupd flags via options in a
configuration file that swupd will read before running the command.
The configuration file is an INI style file tha  can include sections
so users can specify options that should only apply to a specific
command. The biggest advantage of this is to be able to fine tune the
flags that should apply for each command.
For example a user could set a global flag that would apply to every
swupd command, and then turn that flag off for a specific command by
unsetting it in the command's section.

flag to continue with the insecure connection. In order for autoupdate
to work the user will need to add the key/value allow-insecure-http=true
in the swupd config file.
This commit warns the user about this when setting up a mirror with http
so they can take steps to re-enable autoupdate.

The function do_staging is regularly used within a loop to stage all the files for a given bundle-add or update, repair, etc. However when the loop contains a progress report (with a percentage), if there are errors in the do_staging function, they get printed in the same line as the percentage, messing up the output. Like this:
...22%Warning: Update target directory does not exist: some_file...

This commit fixes that output by adding a carriage return at the beginning of each message do_staging could print so it would overlap with the percentage value effectively deleting it.","A suggestion on how to fix the \r problem when redirecting to a file.
Instead of adding the \r to the start of functions that are printed during progress we could always print a \r at the end of the progress report. So if a new message is printed it will print over the progress bar. In that funciton we have information if it is a file or tty, so we can prevent printing \r if it is a file.

That is a good idea",True,{}

Added bundle name completion for swupd search FOO [--deps=|--has-deps=],
Improved completion for swupd search-file [-B=|-l=].

For -B, only files in /usr/bin directory are listed
For -l, only .a or .so files under /usr/lib or /usr/lib64 are
listed


Completions for diagnose and repair are handled separtely because of
non-trivial differences in descriptions of certain options.
--quiet and --debug options of swupd hashdump are mutually exclusive
since only one of them takes effect when both are supplied.
If -p|--path= option and its argument is supplied to swupd hashdump,
completions for the non-option argument is generated by the zsh's native
_path_files function, instead of external program find. This path
completion support partial match, e.g. /u/s/z/5/f is completed to
/usr/share/zsh/5.7.1/functions. This implementation also supports relative
path and  filename expansion (~).
Improved the way how all available bundles are extracted from Manifest file,
it's about 4 times faster in my test.
For completions of bundle names, now the filtering of bundles already in the
buffers is achieved by array difference instead of for loop, which is also
considerably faster.
Multiple helper functions are combined into into three.

So it took about 1/3 of the time than the previous implementation.
When testing it with bundles that cannot be removed (due to dependencies), in my test I still saw a very slight time improvement with this PR:
With master:

The only case where I saw the performance worsen was when only using invalid bundle names:
With master:
$ time sudo ./swupd bundle-remove fake1 fake2 fake3 fake4
Warning: Bundle ""fake1"" is not installed, skipping it...
Warning: Bundle ""fake2"" is not installed, skipping it...

real	0m3.709s
user	0m3.438s
sys	0m0.263s

This is because I switched the order of the checks with do with the provided bundles. In the original code we first check to see if the bundle is installed in the system, if it is not we skip it. In the submitted code it first checks to see if the bundle is valid (is in the MoM). Looking for a tracking file is faster than looking through the MoM, but the new implementation has the advantage that now the message we show is more accurate. In master if you enter an invalid bundle, it will tell you the bundle is not installed (which may be misleading). And besides that, the only moment you will see the performance worsen is if the user enters a bunch of invalid bundles in the same command, which is highly unlikely.",True,{}

When listing the dependencies of a given bundle, swupd uses a tree view
that includes all bundles that depend on the specified bundle, plus all
the bundles that depend on that dependendant bundle, and so on.
Some times for some bundles the list can grow quite large (over 1000
lines) which make the output useless. This PR fixes the issue by simplifying
the list of dependencies if the list is big so it is easier to read.
A --force flag was added to bundle-remove to be used in cases where
a user wants to remove a bundle that is required by other installed bundles
without having to delete one by one.
Removes non critical notifications being sent to telemetry when user was doing
user mistakes while removing

At the moment there is one limitation related to this size calculation.
The size needed to install a bundle is currently being calculated by adding the size of the bundle + the size of all the bundle dependencies - the size of the dependencies already installed in the system.
We can know what dependencies are already installed in the system and which ones are not. But if a dependency is not installed it doesn't mean all the files from the dependency are not installed either, as a matter of fact many files could already be installed in the system. A good example is with the ""emacs"" bundle. The size of that bundle is 138.75 MB, and it has no dependencies (other than os-core). The emacs bundle has 4121, but 4120 of its 4121 files are also included in other bundles, so if those bundles are already installed in the system, that means emacs is basically already installed (even when it is officially not at least to swupd).
Now, the only way I can think of to know what is the real size we would need for a bundle in a system is by collecting the list of files in the bundle and its dependencies, removing the files already present in the system from the list and then adding up the size of each one of the remaining files. The problem is, this could be very expensive in terms of resources/time since the only way we have to know each file's size is by using curl to request the header of each one of those files and getting the size from it. This is really not feasible unless the missing files are less than a few hundreds.",True,{}

As a second thought, I can get the consolidated list of files for the bundle (including files from dependencies), then I can iterate through the list and see if the file is already installed, if it is, I can grab its size from the local file system and subtract that size from the total size of the bundle.

bundle. Among the data currently displayed it includes:

If the bundle is installed or not
If the bundle is experimental or not
If the bundle is installed, it shows if there is an existing update
for the bundle
The latest available version of the bundle
The size of the bundle and all its dependencies
The size needed in disk to install a bundle if not installed

This commit also adds the following command flags:
--version: so a user can display information for a bundle in a
specific version, not only the current version.
--includes: this flag can be used to show all optional and required
bundles that are directly and indirectly included by the specified
bundle.
--files: this flag can be used to show all files that are part of a
given bundle.
All flags can be combined to show specific data.
This is the first of a series of PRs to implement the bundle-info
features referred to at #461.

I would implement the download manifest progress thing for both functions then.

Closes #455","@otaviobp I was able to recreate this behavior but after looking at it closer I think this is working as expected. After following your steps this is the result I got:
$ sudo ./swupd bundle-remove --recursive os-clr-on-clr --path /home/castulo/testfs/target --statedir /home/castulo/testfs/target/state
 [|]
The --recursive option was used, the specified bundle and its dependencies will be removed from the system

The following bundles are being removed:
 - vim
 - os-clr-on-clr

Deleting bundle files...
 [100%]

Total deleted files: 1056

Successfully removed 1 bundle
1 bundle that was installed as a dependency was removed

Let's analyze what happened. This is what we did:

we installed os-clr-on-clr (which installs a bunch of dependencies ~311)
we then marked all installed bundles as ""tracked"" by copying all files from <path>/usr/share/clear/bundles to <statedir>/bundles
then we deleted the tracking file from vim, so this will make swupd think this is the only bundle that was installed as a result of being a dependency
We ran bundle-remove --recursive os-clr-on-clr. This will remove the ""os-clr-on-clr"" bundle since that was the specified bundle, and ""os-clr-on-clr"" is not required by any other installed bundle, so we are good for removing it. Then since --recursive was used, swupd will check the 311 bundles included by os-clr-on-clr to see if they can be removed as well:

All bundles except ""vim"" were manually installed by the user (tracked files) so swupd skip removing all these
vim is not tracked, so swupd proceeds to see if the bundle is required by other bundles. The editors bundle also-add this bundle, but it is an optional bundle, so it is ok to remove it.


vim and os-clr-on-clr are removed.

We can confirm this with bundle-info:
$ sudo ./swupd bundle-info --path /home/castulo/testfs/target --statedir /home/castulo/testfs/target/state --dependencies editors

Closes #455","Hey guys,
I came up with an idea that could distinguish bundle added by users from bundle added as dependencies. It also avoids writing anything to /var directory, which as pointed out by @otaviobp , it could be removed by the user and that would cause problem.
So currently we store the names of all installed bundles under /usr/share/clear/bundles/, and my idea is to add dependency count into those files, which are currently empty.

When the bundle is added, create a file with file name same as bundle name

If the bundle is added as a dependency, its initial content is 2
If the bundle is added by user specifically, its initial content is 1


If the bundle is already added, but later on the user add another bundle that depends on it, increment the value by 2
When removing a bundle, also decrement all its dependencies' contained values by 2
Therefore,

If /usr/share/clear/bundles/FOO has an odd value, its added by user
If /usr/share/clear/bundles/FOO has an even value, its added as a dependency

In this patch I tried to keep the most used style for each filetype. I'm totally ok on changing the python one to spaces.

The major problem we had on mixing tabs and spaces were other files.
So for now it looks like the ideal would be:

.c .h .bash. .sh
Always indent with tabs, tabsize is 8 spaces. (same style used for source files from our history)
python:
4 spaces (python standard)
zsh
4 spaces (that's the style used by other zsh autocomplete scripts on clear)
Autotools files:
Autotools is very sensible to this, so I won't change. Just follow the style in the file you are changing.

@otaviobp The only zsh script currently in the project is the auto-completion. Unfortunately shellcheck doesn't support it. And neither does zsh has style checker like bashate.
On top of this, zsh completion system has its own unique syntax, which is too complicated and not well documented. I wrote the script but after 2 months I cannot remember many syntax.
To consistently employ the test-driven paradigm this project has, we may consider do this.


The baseline is to use _gnu_generic function to automatically generate completion by having zsh call swupd -h in the background. And It's also possible to call swupd -h manually in background and use sed, awk or whatever external command to format the result. This approach only requires a consistent help message style.


To provide more functionality like bundle name completion, we may let zsh call an external helper script to generate the result. This helper should be coded in a language that automatic tests and code style checks are available, such as bash, Python, or C.


The advantage for this design is:

The usage of zsh specific syntax, and especially zsh completion specific syntax, is minimal. So for future maintainers of this project, they don't have to spent hours learning zsh completion system.
The completions are up to date with the latest release of swupd-client, as long as the help message is updated.
Helper script can be used not only by zsh, but also bash! This would greatly help to improve the bash completion.
Helper is could be tested and a consistent format can be enforced.

I'm not changing the style of zsh for now then. Just enforcing what we have.

I like the idea on creating something in common for the bash and zsh autocomplete. My concern is adding an dependency to things we dont need. So a system may have zsh, but not shell or python. I think that autogenerating the autocomplete scripts is easier than trying to maintain another binary that is called to return the autocomplete code. What's is painful on what we have now is that we need to update 2 scripts every time we change any flag in swupd. And all this information is already available in the C code, so it would be way easier to maintain if we had a C code generating the scripts.

Tasks:

 Add support for 3rd-party bundle-add to the testlib
 Add functional tests for adding bundles from a 3rd-party repo
 Add new test group to Travis/github actions
 Add the 3rd-party bundle-add command to swupd (without functionality)
 Add documentation to man pages.
 Add command to autocompletion script swupd.bash
 Add command to autocompletion script swupd.zsh
 Add command to the config file
 Search for 3rd-party bundles in a hardcoded 3rd-party repo URL, and install it (as POC)
 Search for the bundle in 3rd-party repos registered in repo.ini
 When getting the URL of the 3rd-party repo, if there are multiple repos, we need to search for the bundle in all of them
 If the bundle is in multiple bundles we need to ask the user to specify a repo
 When using a 3rd-party repo, we need to get the current version of the system from the appropriate section of the repo.ini config file
 When tracking the installed bundle, we need to track it in the state dir that is specific to the 3rd-party repo.
 Check output correctness and consistency with other commands (including output using --quiet, --verbose, --debug)
 Update release notes draft

As it is shown in this example, the direct dependencies show which of these are optional and which are not. However the Indirect dependencies don't make this distinction. This can be misleading because it looks like all indirect dependencies are mandatory, when in fact, they are not. In this example, all of the indirect dependencies are mandatory dependencies of ""emacs"", ""joe"" or ""vim"", which are optional, and because of this, they may or may not be installed when the ""editors"" bundle is installed.
To avoid the problem mentioned above, with this PR, I decided to show all dependencies (mandatory or optional) as optional if the bundle that is including them is optional. Using the same example it would show like this""

Closes #1159
Signed-off-by: Castulo Martinez castulo.martinez@intel.com","Here is an example of how this implementation works. If you run the command to see what bundles have ""vim"" as a dependency it show this:
$ sudo ./swupd bundle-list --has-dep vim
Installed bundles that have vim as a dependency:
 - editors (as optional)

Total: 1

So swupd will tell you that the ""editors"" bundle has ""vim"" as an optional dependency.
However there are four other bundles that have ""editors"" as a mandatory dependency. So if you run the same command for the editors bundle, you will get this result:
$ sudo ./swupd bundle-list --has-dep editors
Installed bundles that have editors as a dependency:
 - editors-dev
 - os-clr-on-clr
 - os-clr-on-clr-dev
 - user-basic

Total: 4

In this case, since vim is only an optional dependency for editors, it may not necessarily be a dependency for the other four bundles, so I decided to not recurse bundles when looking for bundles that optionally depend on another bundle. If I had recurse bundles, the result from the first command would have looked like this:
$ sudo ./swupd bundle-list --has-dep vim
Installed bundles that have editors as a dependency:
 - editors (as optional)
 - editors-dev
 - os-clr-on-clr
 - os-clr-on-clr-dev
 - user-basic

Total: 5

I think this just makes the result confusing because it would look like vim is a mandatory dependency of the other bundles, so I prefer not to show those bundles....
I guess another option would be to just show it as an optional dependency of the other bundles as well, something like this:
$ sudo ./swupd bundle-list --has-dep vim
Installed bundles that have editors as a dependency:
 - editors (as optional)
 - editors-dev (as optional)
 - os-clr-on-clr (as optional)

I was thinking we should also have something like example section for all swupd commands which lists a few popular ways of using it.... helps a beginner ramp up fast if he/she comes from another linux distro world?
for eg for update:
Usage:
Description:
Example:
swupd update -V 10 -- update to a specific version
swupd update -- updates to latest version
Maybe we can discuss this once @otaviobp is back. Let me know what you feel?

👍 yeah we can discuss it with @otaviobp, I like the idea of having examples but I'm not sure the ""--help"" menus are the best place for them or if we should just have them in the manual. In either case that is separate from this PR.",True,{}

I think you are confused, --path has the same meaning everywhere in swupd since it is a global variable. Even in os-install it has the same meaning, in that case we are changing the path_prefix using --path so we can just use ""repair/verify --fix"" to install missing files in that path.

Closes #1270","Ok, I see now what is going on @karthikprabhuvinod @phmccarty. A paragraph with different indentation in reStructuredText (.rst) is considered a blockquote as @phmccarty mentioned.
""A text block that is indented relative to the preceding text, without preceding markup indicating it to be a literal block or other content, is a block quote. ""
So when GitHub is rendering the file, it is rendering it as an rst file. However we really don't care about the correct rendering of the file in rst mode since we are further converting that file from .rst to man format using rst2man. If I remove the indentation in the document so it renders properly in rst form, we loose the indentation we want in the man page, which is the one we care about.
This is an excerpt of the man page when removing the indentation from the description of the info command:
SUBCOMMANDS
       info

       Shows the current OS version and the URLs used for updates.

       autoupdate [--enable|--disable]
          Enables or disables automatic updates, or reports current status. Enabling updates does not cause an immediate update -
          use swupd update to force one if desired.

You can see how the description from info has different indentation than that of autoupdate, so we cannot really remove the indentation so it renders fine on .rst unless we are ok with loosing the indentation in the man page as shown above.
In that example doesn't look that bad since it was one line, but if removing the indentation from more lines it looks like this:
SUBCOMMANDS
       info

       Shows the current OS version and the URLs used for updates.

       autoupdate [--enable|--disable]

       Enables  or  disables  automatic updates, or reports current status. Enabling updates does not cause an immediate update -
       use swupd update to force one if desired.

       check-update

       Checks whether an update is available and prints out the information if so. Does not download update content.

       update

       Performs a system software update.

       The program will contact the version server at the version url, and check to see if a system software update is available.
       If  an  update  is  available, the update content will be downloaded from the content url and stored in the /var/lib/swupd
       state path. Once all content is downloaded and verified, the update is applied to the system.

       In case any problem arises during a software update, the program attempts to correct the issue, possibly by  performing  a
       swupd repair operation, which corrects broken or missing files and other issues.

       After the update is applied, the system performs an array of post-update actions. These actions are triggered through sys‐
       temd(1) and reside in the update-triggers.target(4) system target.

       • -V, --version

         Update to a specific version, also accepts 'latest' (default).

IMO the swupd commands get lost very easily. I like it better when they are indented.

I think that if we remove the flag restrictions is just going to confuse users, specially since the flags are really not that clear. --extra-files-only is very self explanatory, but --picky and --quick are not. --quick should really be called something like --missing-files-only or something like that so it would make sense. My point is that we have flags that isolate the execution of only one of the 4 tasks verify does (like --picky or --extra-files-only), while we have flags that do not isolate the execution of the task but run it in addition to the other tasks, IMO this behavior is very confusing as a user.",True,{}

Signed-off-by: Otavio Pontes otavio.pontes@intel.com","As I mentioned before, I like the ""weighting system"" you are implementing for balancing the tests across the jobs, but I think we can do better when weighting those tests.
For example, these are the average times each test group take to run (on my system):
( total seconds / number of test )

3rd-party = 261 / 58 = 4.5  ~ 4 s/t
repair = 148 / 44 = 3.4 ~ 3 s/t
diagnose = 82 / 27 = 3 s/t
signature = 51 / 20 = 2.5 ~ 2 s/t
update = 140 / 60 = 2.3	~ 2 s/t
bundleremove = 62 / 29 = 2.1 ~ 2 s/t
verify-legacy = 12 / 6 = 2 s/t
checkupdate = 21 / 11 = 1.9 ~ 2 s/t
bundlelist = 47 / 26 = 1.8 ~ 2 s/t
bundleadd = 81 / 53 = 1.5 ~ 1 s/t
bundleinfo = 20 / 14 = 1.4 ~ 1 s/t
os-install = 35 / 25 = 1.4 ~ 1 s/t
autoupdate = 1 s/t
usability = 17 / 19 = 0.9 ~ 1 s/t
search = 23 / 30 = 0.8 ~ 1 s/t
info = 1.6 / 2 = 0.8 ~ 1s/t
mirror = 7 / 18 = 0.3s/t
hashdump = 1 / 3 = 0.3 ~ 1 s/t

So if we round up or down to the closes integer for each group we can create 4 different ""weight groups"" that go from 1 to 4 (which represent average seconds a test in a group takes to complete). Using those 4 values we can average like this:
average() {
    i=$1
    TESTS=$2

	# start with the special cases
	if [[ $i == *'UPD025'* ]]; then
		TESTS=$((TESTS * 120))
	elif [[ $i == *'/3rd-party/'* ]]; then
		TESTS=$((TESTS * 4))
	elif [[ $i == *'/repair/'* || $i == *'/diagnose/'* ]]; then
		TESTS=$((TESTS * 3))
	elif [[ $i == *'/signature/'* || $i == *'/update/'* || $i == *'/bundleremove/'* || $i == *'/verify-legacy/'* || $i == *'/checkupdate/'* || $i == *'/bundlelist/'* ]]; then
		TESTS=$((TESTS * 2))
	fi
    echo $TESTS

The first one is a real issue, while the 2nd case is a nuisance and
probably a bug in bsdtar (as GNU tar still works fine).
To fix this behaviour, we can simply use linkat(2) instead of
link(2) to instruct the kernel to follow the symlink if the
Manifest states that the file should be a symlink. This ensures
that the new file created is a symlink itself, not a hardlink to
a pre-existing symlink.
linkat(2) as used in this patch is available since linux v2.6.18

I just have some considerations about the problems you listed.

There are two issues with this:
1. the file system structure created using the swupd client doesn't
   match the original file system (which was more like case /b)


Actually this is working as designed. We don't guarantee that the installed system will be identical to the original filesystem. If there are 2 files that have exactly the same hash they will be hardlinked even if they are different files in the orginal system.

2. it becomes impossible to copy the directory tree using bsdtar [1]

I made a hack script to generate them. We need a better script. The only reason it's a tarball and not a text file is root permissions. We could change the permissions and fix them before running the test if we prefer to keep them as text files.

The basic idea of this PR is to run everything on test_setup() and save the results in tarballs to be committed to the repository. So when we need to run the tests we don't need to execute test_setup() again. We just extract the tarballs to the correct location and uses it to execute the tests.
For comparison reasons I created 2 jobs on github actions to run in serial all repair tests using the new approach and the old approach. Tests using the tarball cache are around 10 times faster than tests that generate all the data. I have tested that only with repair tests.
Some improvements necessary:

Instead of having specific generate scripts we could keep the generation code in bats file
Create a script to automatically clean and regenerate the cache

Today files are created for tests in 2 different moments. On global_setup() or test_setup(). And we support just one of those cases. If global_setup() is used all tests are running with the same environment (what's bad) and the result of one test impact the other. If test_setup() is used the environment is recreated for every test. global_setup() and test_setup() are also used to start/stop services that may be needed by the test (like the webserver).
The major proposal of this PR is to create another step that is used to generate any file that would be reused by all tests on the test file in a way that it could be cached. I called this step metadata_setup(). Metadata_setup is called only once for each test file and all generated files are copied to the specific test directory to be reused by the test.
Changes made to accomplish that:

Separate the creation of a test directory from the creation of a mix. We may want to use the testlib for tests that doesn't require any mix to be created.
Explicit mix creation. Instead of creating an env on test_setup with default parameters, it's up to the user to define how to create the environment. This prevents us to need override test_setup() with an empty body. Directory for the test data is still created and mandatory. It's cheap and it can be used by testlib to store any file needed.
Create keys to sign the release on testlib and not in another test. Now we are creating one key for each test file because it's easier to cache.
Create a step to be used to create metadata and copy it to every test.

So now, if we have 3 tests in a example.bats file we will have the following workflow:

global_setup() #TEST_NAME=example
metadata_setup() #TEST_NAME=example_META
test_setup() #TEST_NAME=example_001 and everything saved to example_META is copied to example_001 before starting
test_teardown() #TEST_NAME=example_001
test_setup() #TEST_NAME=example_002 and everything saved to example_META is copied to example_002 before starting
test_teardown() #TEST_NAME=example_002
test_setup() #TEST_NAME=example_003 and everything saved to example_META is copied to example_003 before starting
test_teardown() #TEST_NAME=example_003
global_teardown() # TEST_NAME=example",True,{}

On global_setup() or test_setup().

Yes, and this the way all other test frameworks work

And we support just one of those cases.

What do you mean we only support one of those cases? You can use both if you want in a test at the same time. This would be the workflow of a test file if all setups and teardown are used (assuming we have 2 tests in the file):
global setup

test setup
test 1 runs
test teardown

test setup
test 2 runs
test teardown

global teardown

And again, this is pretty standard of any test framework.

If global_setup() is used all tests are running with the same environment (what's bad) and the result of one test impact the other. If test_setup() is used the environment is recreated for every test.

I disagree with this statement, whatever is done in the global_setup() impacts all the tests, but that is definitely not bad, you only have to choose the right actions to run there (if any). For example in an application that needs the user to authenticate you may want to use the global setup to login to the application that is going to be tested so you don't have to do it for every test. In our case, global setups are really not that useful because of the nature of our application and our tests, most of the times we don't want to use it precisely because we use global_setup and test_setup to create environments that we modify with tests, and we cannot really reuse an environment if it was already modified by another test or we would have the conflict you talk about where one test could impact the result of the next. I still think global_setup is useful for a few of our tests, for example tests that only list things without changing anything, we can create only one environment and reuse it in all tests, that makes the test faster.

global_setup() and test_setup() are also used to start/stop services that may be needed by the test (like the webserver).


The major proposal of this PR is to create another step that is used to generate any file that would be reused by all tests on the test file in a way that it could be cached. I called this step metadata_setup(). Metadata_setup is called only once for each test file and all generated files are copied to the specific test directory to be reused by the test.

I'm all about saving execution time by caching stuff that we create over and over, specially since the creation of that test data consumes most of the time of the test. I think it is a good idea. I just want us to be careful about it so we don't impact the experience of using the test library when run locally and interactively. I'm not sure how you use the test library, but I use it a lot interactively for debugging. Also I wouldn't want the library to divert from what is expected from a test library, for example as I said a ""global setup"" is pretty standard in any test framework, so I would expect it to behave similarly to a global setup in other frameworks.

Changes made to accomplish that:

Separate the creation of a test directory from the creation of a mix. We may want to use the testlib for tests that doesn't require any mix to be created.
Explicit mix creation. Instead of creating an env on test_setup with default parameters, it's up to the user to define how to create the environment. This prevents us to need override test_setup() with an empty body. Directory for the test data is still created and mandatory. It's cheap and it can be used by testlib to store any file needed.


I'm ok with this, in fact, I also prefer it this way. I ended up adding the default actions in test_setup and test_teardown as a result of a direct request when folks were reviewing the implementation of the test library.


Create keys to sign the release on testlib and not in another test. Now we are creating one key for each test file because it's easier to cache.
Create a step to be used to create metadata and copy it to every test.



So now, if we have 3 tests in a example.bats file we will have the following workflow:

global_setup() #TEST_NAME=example
metadata_setup() #TEST_NAME=example_META
test_setup() #TEST_NAME=example_001 and everything saved to example_META is copied to example_001 before starting
test_teardown() #TEST_NAME=example_001
test_setup() #TEST_NAME=example_002 and everything saved to example_META is copied to example_002 before starting
test_teardown() #TEST_NAME=example_002
test_setup() #TEST_NAME=example_003 and everything saved to example_META is copied to example_003 before starting
test_teardown() #TEST_NAME=example_003
global_teardown() # TEST_NAME=example


I'm a little confused in this workflow. If you are creating metadata_setup between global setup and test setup... does that mean that metadata will only contain stuff that otherwise would have been created during the global setup?",True,{}

If there's a way to do it, let me know.

I understand your point now, and yes, currently there is no way to safely create a test environment in a global_setup and then create bundles in a test_setup. To do something like that, we would need to implement a destroy_bundle function that would revert whatever we did with create_bundle and call that function in the test_teardown, similar to what I did with the tests in add-basics.bats: https://github.com/clearlinux/swupd-client/blob/master/test/functional/bundleadd/add-basics.bats#L22

When I said that the user needs to choose one, I meant that the user needs to choose to create the mix for global or for local.

Yeah, this is true with the current capabilities of testlib without implementing more functions to destroy/revert test resources

It splits the cache and data in the internal memory into two different locations.
It stores the cache in a path that is dependent of the url of the update content server
Removes hardcoded references to files in the cache and data throughout the code so they can be relocated easily at any time if desired.
Sets the read permissions of the data directory to be world readable.
Sets the read permissions of all directories in the cache to be readable by root only with the exception of the manifest directory which is world readable.
Updates the swupd clean and swupd 3rd-party clean commands so they remove cache from the new location.
The swupd clean and swupd 3rd-party clean commands  will continue to clean cache from the old locations until the bump to format 31 to make sure we don't leave old files behind.
It introduces the --cachedir and --datadir which can be used to set the locations of the cache and data respectively. If users want to set both paths to the same location they can still use --statedir to set both paths at once.
