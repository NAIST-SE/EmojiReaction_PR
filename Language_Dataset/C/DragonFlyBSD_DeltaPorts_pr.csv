lang/rust builds locally and will be in ports on next merge.  It is at version 1.7 and is required for firefox building (at least with default options).
lang/rust-nightly: The DF support is wrong.  I have added many patches to DeltaPorts and it builds for a while but coredumps with the stage2 rustc (version 1.9)
lang/rust-dragonfly: this is at version 1.3.  I will mark it ""IGNORE"" for now since lang/rust is a lot newer with the idea of removing the port soon.

ISSUE FOR 1) and 2)
Dragonfly is the only BSD that requires profcs to get the executable name.  I really want to change this.  For some reason, when I patch the file to use sysctl KERN_PROC_PATHNAME like freebsd, it just doesn't work.  I'd really, really like to fix it (if not I have to patch Synth and A) I don't want to and B) there's only one port that requires procfs and I'd rather it stay at 1 rather than move to 3)
So I put a ton of work into Rust (something I don't use) so I'd like some help and ideally these patches need to get pushed upstream too.",True,{}

Rust: I have patches to build lang/rust-nightly, but not lang/rust. If you made lang/rust work, that's perfect, because the Makefile in lang/rust-nightly depend on the other port. I have upstream patches, which I hope will be in 1.8, so rust builds out-of-the-box without any changes on Dragonfly. It coredumps, because a patch is missing which is related to jemalloc. Actually to build Rust you'd need rust-lang/rust#32687 and rust-lang/rust#32686.
Please remove rust-dragonfly.
procfs: I actually changed it from KERN_PROC_PATHNAME to use the procfs, because I couldn't get it to work otherwise on DragonFly. I think KERN_PROC_PATHNAME returns the resolved path, while procfs returns the virtual path, used when starting the executable. HAMMER had ""@@"" in the resolved path, I don't know if this caused problems or not.

For the errno, I just returned 0 because it seems only the sanitizers used errno_location.  I think the change was ok, but your errno TLS fix is better.
There were other ramifications to fixing the clock arguments though.  Maybe that's been fixed in head already.
We need to make another attempt at removing procfs.  It's deprecated on FreeBSD and should be in DF too.  There's only one port (before rust) that would not build without /proc mounted, rust will increase the number (when we want that number to be zero).

Also I don't understand why the author/maintainer prevent the binary distribution linked with non-OpenSSL (e.g., LibreSSL) of this port [1]!  If I remember correctly, LibreSSL's license can only be more permissive than OpenSSL's.
Stunnel's license says [2]:

In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holder of stunnel gives you permission to combine stunnel with free software programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with code included in the standard release of OpenSSL under the OpenSSL License (or modified versions of such code, with unchanged license). You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for stunnel and the licenses of the other code concerned.

For several reasons below, I currently don't use Stunnel:

Newer OpenVPN (may be >= 2.4.x) introduced a new configuration tls-crypt to encrypt its control communication, making it harder be identified and blocked; therefore, Stunnel is not required;
Stunnel with OpenVPN on the server side also requires additional configurations on the client side;
ocserv (OpenConnect Server) seems more easier to configure and more efficient;  So I'm try to make ocserv work well with DragonFly BSD (there is currently a issue with DFly's tun device/interface).

well, does the dfly-patch target still succeed in removing ""-Werror""?

The current dfly-patch only takes care of the src/Makefile, but there are still other places with -Werror enabled, e.g., configure.ac, {libcork,libipset}/CMakeLists.txt.

No port should be built with Werror, ever ...

Sorry, but I don't get the point here.  If the developers and porters managed to enable the -Werror compiler flag, wouldn't it be better?

-Werror should never be used on a release build.  On a developer/debug build, sure.
This is a long standing debate.  So people feel the opposite that I do (but they're wrong!).
basically, new warnings are added by compiler developers all the time.  Over time, perfectly good code will eventually emit a warning as compilers get newer.  The build should never break just by upgrading the compiler.  -Werror causes all sorts of problems for ports/pkg collections.

Thanks to zrj for pointing this out. I verified that it produces a working binary; it adds ""(FLAGS)              ORIGIN"" and ""(FLAGS_1) Flags: ORIGIN"" to the binary. So the proper solution would be to add a patch upstream.
However, I ran a quick test and it appears that DragonFly differs from FreeBSD and Linux in that the latter two do not need to set ""FLAGS"" and ""FLAGS_1"" in the binary. ORIGIN in rpath is parsed w/o the flags set.
Should DragonFly follow FreeBSD and Linux in this? It'd reduce the number of patches we need.

https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54015","Yes, that's true. I was too cryptic, let me elaborate.
The root of the issue is that DragonFly behaves differently from both FreeBSD and Linux with respect to how $ORIGIN is handled. DragonFly needs ""-Wl,-z,origin"" at linking so that ""(FLAGS) ORIGIN"" and ""(FLAGS_1)  Flags: ORIGIN"" are set in the binary. If the latter are set, $ORIGIN is expanded correctly; if not, $ORIGIN is not expanded and the shared library is not found. The requirement that the latter two flags are needed in order for $ORIGIN expansion seems standard behavior; or at least it was standard at some point.
However, FreeBSD and Linux do not care if ""(FLAGS) ORIGIN"" and ""(FLAGS_1)  Flags: ORIGIN"" are set in the binary. I.e. even if they are not set, $ORIGIN in rpath or runpath is still expanded correctly and the shared library is found. I tested this with a small example found in the thread above
https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54015
This is the reason inkscape fails to start on DragonFly but not on FreeBSD. I installed inkscape on FreeBSD and tested that it runs fine. The inkscape header on FreeBSD reads:
% readelf -d /usr/local/bin/inkscape | grep ORIGIN
.... RPATH  Library rpath: [$ORIGIN/../lib/inkscape:/usr/local/lib]
.... RUNPATH  Library runpath: [$ORIGIN/../lib/inkscape:/usr/local/lib]
I do not know why FreeBSD and Linux behave so.
It is correct that ld.bfd and ld.gold do not differ with respect to ""-Wl,-z,origin"". Both need this explicitly in order that ""(FLAGS)"" etc be in the binary on DragonFly. The difference is that with ""MAKE_ENV+= LDVER=ld.bfd"", the required ""-Wl,-z,origin"" is added in the linking phase. Question: why are those flags added with ld.bfd?
(As a side, compiling with ""-Wl,-z,origin"" on FreeBSD results in a binary where ""(FLAGS)"" and ""(FLAGS_1)"" are just empty. Compiling with ""-Wl,-z,origin,-rpath"" as suggested in the libreoffice thread above yields empty fields too. No idea how to correctly set ""(FLAGS)"" etc on FreeBSD. But then it does not matter, FreeBSD does not care anyway.)
All in all it might not be a good idea to fix this using LDVER=ld.bfd. One could have used LDFLAGS+= ""-Wl,-z,origin"", this explicitly shows the fix. The result is the same, the ""(FLAGS)"" etc are set correctly and inkscape runs fine.
In light of this, there are at least three options:
(1) USE_LDCONFIG+= ${PREFIX}/lib/inkscape,
(2) LDFLAGS+= ""-Wl,-z,origin"",
(3) LDVER=ld.bfd
What's the best option to use?
The general question is whether or not DragonFly might want to align the behavior with respect to $ORIGIN with Linux/FreeBSD?",True,{}

I'm guessing the reason z,origin isn't requires on linux, freebsd (or solaris) is because they use ld.bfd and dragonfly uses gold linker by default, thus gold linker must explicitly require the flag (which is debatably incorrect).

(1) use our input.h etc that we have exported at /usr/include/compat/linux. This entails we have to patch ports with sth like
-I/usr/include/compat
in order that includes of the form
#include <linux/input.h>
work.
(2) Or we can fake, i.e. make our own copy of evdev-proto whose content (input.h, input-event-codes.h) will be taken from our tree. Then we do not need patches like the ones in (1) on top of the ones that FreeBSD already have for input.h
(3) Or we go with FreeBSD's evdev-proto. This will lead to many headaches down the road since our kernel interface might not be in sync with what FreeBSD/Linux have.
Option (1) was the initial one we came up with. But now I realize that perhaps (2) is also possible, and at least at first sight needs less patching than (1).
One issue that will come up (but that will come up with all approaches) is dependency problem. Port A may require that libinput be not less than X.Y, but our lower stack (our input.h) might yet not support that.",True,{}

/usr/include/compat
gives us control over what will happen. This is option (1) above. This is in fact what we have in place now: we have exported input.h at /usr/include/compat/linux, we'd just need to add -I/usr/include/compat where necessary.",True,{}
