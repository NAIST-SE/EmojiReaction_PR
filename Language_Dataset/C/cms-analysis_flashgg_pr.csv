Setting puweight to one for data in GlobalVariablesComputer.","good point... the branch is created unconditionally in the patched version ( https://github.com/andreh7/flashgg/blob/2016-04-22-puweight-var/Taggers/src/GlobalVariablesDumper.cc#L83 ) so there should be no problem at the level of hadd.
Admittedly this is wasting a bit of space in the output tree when pileup reweighting is disabled.
On the other hand, it's flashgg/MetaData/python/JobConfig.py which enables pileup reweighting (if puTarget is specified) except for data, so GlobalVariablesDumper currently can't not know if pileup reweighting is disabled in its configuration because the job is running on data or because it was disabled for all jobs.
One could modify JobConfig.py set the parameter 'puReweight' to True also for data and pass the pileup weights as it if were MC. The patch already sets the output variable puweight to one in GlobalVariablesComputer.cc if evt.isRealData() is true, independent of whether pileup reweighting is enabled or not.
The only other place where the parameter 'puReWeight' appears is in Validation/plugins/globelikeTreeMakerWithTagSorter.cc but this ignores pileup reweighting for data already and creates the branch whether pileup reweighting is enabled or not.
The easiest solution would be to create the puweight branch (in GlobalVariablesDumper) whether pileup reweighting is enabled or not.
However I just noticed that for MC and pileup reweighting disabled, cache_.puweight is not correctly initialized in GlobalVariablesComputer.cc, I can update the pull request.",True,{}

The reason extra packages were being loaded was that I had merged with 808patchX cmssw release.  I have now changed to 80X and fewer packages are checked out.

MiniAODv2 had a buggy version of the id mva, so to validate I had to run the buggy code to confirm that the ID MVA value was the same one stored, for 0th vertices.  This was only true most of the time, but I assume the differences come down to running on Candidates in MiniAOD-production vs running on PackedCandidates later.
After this validation I include a version of the code to fix the bug.  Note that this is in a new cmssw branch that's included from setup.sh
Next I edited the code so that it would respect our non-0th vertex choice.  The results seem sane-ish but I have no way to validate this but look at distributions.  That's why this first pass is needed in MicroAOD","Support the latest 80x pileup id mva, so that we can do further study as part of the VBF tag.  This is needed for MicroAOD processing.

I suggest to accept the feature but leave untouched the catalog, as in
local I have merged it already with some more finished samples and it
would certainly conflict with this PR, which means I should re-import
and re-check everything. I can do the merging of the _ext samples tonight.

additional tags and producers to run sigmaM categorisation instead of the usual tags;
changes in workspaceStd.py so that from one python both versions of the workspaces (standard analysis and fiducial measurement) can be run. The default is the standard analysis, the fiducial one can be turned on specifying doFiducial=True on the command line.

Is Systematics/python/escales/Golden22June.py used anywhere?

thanks for having a look at this. About your comments:

the file is not used anywhere for the workspace production, I'll remove it from the PR
I agree on that, I guess for instance the manipulation of  the tagsequence and the tagsorter would better belong to the systematics customization config. As you said, we can keep it as it is for the moment and organise it better in the future.

The input puSIM values can be changed easily according to different simulation condition, such as from Spring16 to Moriond17.
By default in the codes,  the probValues from the ""OOT cfi file"" were used as input for mcpu  (GlobalVariablesComputer.cc) to calculate the PU weights.  Then PU weight is assigned to each MC event according to the true Npu in this MC event in the codes.
The codes for the calculation of PU weights (GlobalVariablesComputer.cc) will not be problem in technology, if the input mcpu values are reasonable.  As shown in my slide 5 [1] or checked from the ""OOT cfi file"" directly for Spring16,  the problem is that the probValues are 0 when Npu>38 until Npu up to 50. These 0 values in the denominator for the calculation of PU weights in  GlobalVariablesComputer.cc will  cause PU weight problem, as we have seen from our lower mass signal modeling.
From my investigation with  ICHEP dataset and Spring16 80X DY MC, it's better to use the true simulated PU distributions as  input for the calculation of PU weights, when looking at the Nvtx distributions from Zee data and MC.
With this PR changes, one can also compare the validation results from two methods (probValues from the ""OOT cfi file"" or from the true simulated PU), with the Zee events from re-reco data and the exist Spring16 MC or  Moriond17 MC in near future.

The old procedure and your procedure fill in values for puObj.mcPU that are qualtatively different from each other [1], but then they use the values in the same way in subsequent processing.  We need to understand which set of numbers is the right one, or whether our calculation procedure corresponds to one set of numbers and not the other.  I'll start a thread on the flashgg list...

The PU weights should be calculated in GlobalVariablesComputer.cc and controlled by JobConfig.py.  I don't think I have applied the PU weights twice.
@mplaner  Sorry for the confusion.  I was using the ""simulated and reconstructed Npu"" in MC (getPU_NumInteractions, or obsPU in the codes) and reconstructed nPU from data to calculate the weights. I did not use these Prob Values from CFI.

the handling of the binning of the global variables has been improved, adding also the possibility to specify a variable binning;

I don't think it is a good idea to split recipes for uAOD production
and post-uAOD processing. It is yet one more hassle for people doing
analysis and/or needing from time to time to independently produce and
look at uAODs.

Why should this be needed? Do we really gain so much by having this split?

I feel we are diverging towards complications.

My 2 cents,
Federico

Exception Message:
 We need to setJetCollectionIndex to a value more than MaxJetCollections=8 -- you must reconfigure and rerun
----- End Fatal Exception -------------------------------------------------

This fix is related to the fact that we run a separate round of PFCHS clustering for each vertex that has an attached diphoton, as well as the 0th vertex, so that whichever diphoton we pick later we have a different jet collection.  Usually this is only 1 or 2 jet collections, but it can rarely be more.  (If there are 4 EM objects in the event, there are 432/2 = 12 candidate diphotons, each of which in principle can be matched to a different vertex, although in practice this would be a very strange event.)   For technical reasons, we have to specify a fixed maximum number of jet collections in the configuration.  Formerly, this was 8 and there was no problem, but in the ReMiniAOD it seems that more is required.  I changed it to 10.
I've confirmed the event above can be processed with the current fix, and I am now resubmitting the 1 job to complete the DoubleEG catalog.

Ok so you can verify that the stored weights are identical e.g. taking the two ttH files:
i) before PDFWeightObjectProducer update
https://cmsweb.cern.ch/das/request?view=list&limit=50&instance=prod%2Fphys03&input=file%3D%2Fstore%2Fgroup%2Fphys_higgs%2Fcmshgg%2Fsethzenz%2Fflashgg%2FRunIISummer16-2_4_1-25ns_Moriond17%2F2_4_1%2FttHToGG_M125_13TeV_powheg_pythia8_v2%2FRunIISummer16-2_4_1-25ns_Moriond17-2_4_1-v0-RunIISummer16MiniAODv2-PUMoriond17_80X_mcRun2_asymptotic_2016_TrancheIV_v6-v1%2F170114_093929%2F0000%2FmyMicroAODOutputFile_12.root
ii) after PDFWeightObjectProducer update
https://cmsweb.cern.ch/das/request?input=file%3D%2Fstore%2Fuser%2Fgkrintir%2Fflashgg%2FRunIISummer16-2_4_2-25ns_Moriond17%2F2_4_2%2FttHToGG_M125_13TeV_powheg_pythia8_v2%2FRunIISummer16-2_4_2-25ns_Moriond17-2_4_2-v0-RunIISummer16MiniAODv2-PUMoriond17_80X_mcRun2_asymptotic_2016_TrancheIV_v6-v1%2F170310_113651%2F0000%2FmyMicroAODOutputFile_12.root&instance=prod%2Fphys03
For the TH samples we also checked that what we need are stored, e.g.
https://cmsweb.cern.ch/das/request?input=file%3D%2Fstore%2Fuser%2Fgkrintir%2Fflashgg%2FRunIISummer16-2_4_2-25ns_Moriond17%2F2_4_2%2FTHQ_HToGG_13TeV-madgraph-pythia8_TuneCUETP8M1%2FRunIISummer16-2_4_2-25ns_Moriond17-2_4_2-v0-RunIISummer16MiniAODv2-PUMoriond17_80X_mcRun2_asymptotic_2016_TrancheIV_v6-v1%2F170310_184042%2F0000%2FmyMicroAODOutputFile_1.root&instance=prod%2Fphys03
Before merging, let me then erase the last exception in MicroAODCustomize, before the TH samples are fully treated as signal:

I think the plan was remake the secondary vertices, since we don't use the
default primary vertex in H->yy and we actually create the set of jets
corresponding to different primary vertices so the secondary vertices are
to be regenerated correspondingly.

The values of the CSVv2 and the CMVAv2 will be stored also for the jet
collections of the zero-th primary vertex.

There is an option to not re-evaluate the secondary vertices, but then that
would be the case for all the jet collections in the way it is implemented.
The recommendation was to recompute the secondary vertices since for some
of the jet collections, the primary vertex is not the zero-th one.

https://github.com/cms-analysis/flashgg/pull/925/files#diff-2a98a870d06e8f73fb46887dee585251R210

Then the default set of secondary vertices will be used (that correspond
only to the zero-th primary vertex, even though the jet collection may be
made with a different primary vertex).

There was an update to the TnP code which should run successfully in 924.  Additionally, I removed or updated the Validation files which were not compiling in 92X.  As far as I understand, no one has used the removed plugins for quite some time.  This update reflects the currently recommended tag-probe producer from EGM.  They may update it at some point, but the branch which is cloned in setup_9_2_X.sh works in 924.

In fact in my mind this option is just to be used only to reread micro and reproduce diphotons with 0th vertex on the fly,
 this is why it is called “FromMicro”. But maybe this is not a satisfying solution.

no I did not try to update the microAOD. I only try to reread microAOD and build up new diphotons on the fly

thanks","@michelif In principle the production is already started as a test (3_0_0), but I can integrate this and use it when submitting further jobs (3_0_1).   Then eventually if a rerun isn't required for another reason, we can go back and replace the 3_0_0 jobs with new 3_0_1's.  I'll work on that now.
In the meantime are there any other changes forseen for HH?  In particular, is there any special configuration to be done for signal samples?  At the moment they are labelled as background samples, hence no PDF information is propagated -- is this OK?
Finally, can you let me know which MINIAODSIM samples would be high priority for testing this code?  Some HH signals I suppose, but please send the exact sample name(s).",True,{}

thanks","Hi Seth,
thanks. For the final analysis we need this on basically all samples (HH, diphoton, g+Jets, all single higgs, data, t(t)g(g)). It is not super-urgent anyway (we'll have a workshop next week, after that we will have a clearer time scale). For the moment, your idea to have some samples to see that everything and then go back to another reproduction of the samples is ok.
The easiest sample for you to produce, useful for us, would be ZH since I have two photons and two jets with a mass peak.
Of course the HH samples would be the best. The exact names looking on DAS are these ones [1], node_SM would be the one highest priority. I remember a mail exchange between you @andreypz and @dmajumder about running on these samples but I don't remember if the problem there was solved. I also let them comment about the PDF (naively I think we should have the PDF info).

SWGuideMuonIdRun2","@sethzenz  Indeed the MiniIsolation value is not stored in the Muon object. It would
be more clear and safer if the code is parametrized to get the working
point instead of the isolation cut. it is only used by ttHHadronic for some
non standard selection :

if you agree we can ask them to adapt the code and their configurations.
otherwise i can work to use the standard modules of cmssw to read the
miniisolation value and import it into the muon object.

an addpkg command to put in place the packages that were to be changed by a merge command
The merge command itself.

This PR mixes up some blocks and partially removes others, which is inefficient because the packages were added but without any changes.  I am going to start out by removing these entirely to check if we no longer need them:
-# Straightforward update for 8_0_28	
-echo ""Tweaking ConfigToolBase.py to avoid assuming soft link path...""	
-git cms-addpkg FWCore/GuiBrowsers #temp-by hand	
-git cms-merge-topic -u sethzenz:for-flashgg-toolbase-9_4_0	

-echo ""Setting up weight stuff...""	
-git cms-addpkg CommonTools/UtilAlgos	
-git cms-merge-topic -u sethzenz:for-flashgg-weightscount-9_4_0

If it works with those blocks out then they'll stay out, otherwise I'll put them back.  Either way I'll update the setup file to restore the structure.",True,{}

In 1 week, the removed samples will also be removed from DAS and deleted from EOS.  Please let me know ASAP if you see mistakes in the accounting.","Combines 3_1_0 and 3_1_1 catalogs, which use the same code except for a fix to the STXS info for VBF samples.  The 3_1_X catalog removes some overlaps that arose for 3 reasons:

Update of VBF samples to produce non-buggy versions
Rerun of samples that were still being producer
Operator error

Note that in all 3 cases the latter-produced sample is equivalent or better, so the former is removed.  A complete list of samples being removed is:

However, I think it is not mergeable like this in flashgg because it modifies the tags definitions (in flashggTags and also directly in the leptonic tagger). Maybe this was meant only for people to be able to test it. However it would be very nice to have it included permanently in flashgg. So let's discuss this via email. Cheers, Julie",True,{}

can you please tell me what is the status of these JEC corrections? Has this implementation been tested technically?
It would be nice if Ed could add them to the STXS upcoming result. Probably he can get them back directly from this PR.

No problem! Was just composing an email to explain things further but you beat me to it :)


Firstly, no this does not include the updates from the HIG-18-029 analysis. Ed plans to make a PR after he has finished writing his thesis.


I was discussing this with Ed a few hours ago (so will cc him in), but this may indeed impact the recent STXS analysis. I have integrated the updated Rivet tool [1] upstream in CMSSW, which replaces the stage 1 information with 1.1. You can see the changes here: [2]. This means that the updates from Ed in their current state will not work after this PR, however he said he could make changes to his stuff to accommodate the 1.1. What do you think about this?


Concerning the upstream changes: it may not be appropriate to make an offical PR to CMSSW right now, since other analyses are still using the old stage 1 process definitions. Can you instead add a line to setup_flashgg.sh to merge these changes? You may need to add the following packages as well:
 git cms-addpkg SimDataFormats/HTXS
 git cms-addpkg GeneratorInterface/RivetInterface


For the technical points:


1) Are you referring to the newly added Rivet code: HiggsTemplateCrossSections.cc in CMSSW. Apart from that, there are no new c++ files in flashgg. And, yes I ran the flashgg setup script.


2) Will do. I don't think the diphotonsDumper_cfg.py file is configured for the new metaConditions anyway. Only the vbf_dumper_2017.py.


Cheers,

Jonathon

Hi @jonathon-langford<https://github.com/jonathon-langford>,

thank you for this. Does this include also updates from Ed about the recently approved STXS results?
Is this expect to impact anything else than STXS analyis? At a first look it doesn't sees so, which is good.

Few technical points:

  *   please add the Emacs and Vi snippets at the bottom of any newly added c++ file to ensure that the

in your working area, i.e. did you run the flashgg setup script?)
  *   rollback the test file names to file:myMicroAOD.root instead of your custom ones.

thanks a lot. Can you please later add here a link to the validation plots? I will also undo the changes you made to fix the crash, the issue is that the setup script does not take care of copying the QGL db file under flashgg/ and so the fix has to be made in the setup script rather than in flashggJets_cfi.py (unfortunately the QGL implementation is not very smart and this dirty trick is the only one that makes it work both locally and on the GRID).

Julie pointed out that it's not optimal to have the ecalBadCalibFilter, which has to be rerun on top of miniAOD, be applied at microAOD production level. This is because it will filter events even for analyses that don't use MET.
So instead, I added a member variable to the Met data format which stores the result of the filter. Tags for which Met is important can then decide at workspace production level if they want to cut on the filter or not.",True,{}

   Yes, I checked the probe values of 3 Gjet samples with the "" Autumn18 ""
values.  I found  that, they are almost similar, although the individual
per bin values are not exactly same.

The ""Autumn18 "" probe values are here :
https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/SimGeneral/MixingModule/python/mix_2018_25ns_JuneProjectionFull18_PoissonOOTPU_cfi.py


Here is the plot of the distributions of the probe values of Gjet sample
and the ""Autumn18"" :

I don't know, whether this will be the case for all the MC as it is for
Gjet samples.

Thank you,
Prasant

Since the PR has conflicts I would rather merge the STXS PR first and then deal with the conflicts here only once.

Actually I changed the implementation of this to produce a new collection of diphotons with the weights added, and left it configurable whether to apply the weight to the central value. So there should be no need to apply the weights separately in the individual taggers.
Also, I think it makes sense to have the new collection rather than the TagSorter since the eventual weight depends on the jet collection, which in turn depends on the vertex.

I've also tested that it still runs properly -- it does, but I had to remove a couple parts. The first is just a single line (commit aa45d1c) and the second (83d00e4) is related to the overlap removal code the @mhl0116 implemented a while ago.
The overlap removal is only relevant for background MC (i.e. only relevant for personal studies, not any official results), so I think it's fine to comment it out for now. It's unclear to me what exactly is causing the crash, but it seems to be a bad pointer to the genParticles in the tagger.

Shall I close this and wait from a PR on your side with the latest changes? Also it's not clear to me if this additional systematics is loaded correctly if we run the ttH tag together with all the others, have you ever checked the behavior in that scenatio?

Thank you,

 but this weight will not be included in the ttHtags while running the full tag sequence, this will need to be changed.
Hualin, in any case when you will have more time it would be great to commit all the needed changes
to flashgg so that ttH results can be reproduced.  And we will need to think about how to make ttH tags work
with the full tag sequence in, since there are also more complex modifications to integrate (systematics workflow for example).

the HH part of the PR looks ok, but I have mejor concerns about the ttH+HH part some of them have been pointed out with inline comments, I want to stress the following:

The classes used to compute the on the fly reweighting can, and should, be compiled through scram.
Having a separate makefile (which is not even a makefile but a script) is a recipe for a disaster.
We should discuss the details in person but having a list of microAOD file to process is also something that we want to avoid (let alone the file with a nanoAOD list!). We should use the catalogues and JobConfig for that. With fggRunJobs you can use it and you can also specify any executable or script to be run.
There hare hardcoded file names and commets that need a cleanup
This is low priority but we should move the gen info that are now in the DoubleHTag into the GenDiphoton object.

I understand why you wish to have such a function in the code, however we would really prefer not to add this because it does not include the reconstructed weights, and in fact it is not really the proper way to do it at reco level. Very easy way to get the proper normalization is the following :


When running the trees you also run genAnalyzer with function Force :
doDoubleHGenAnalysis=True doubleHReweight=1 ForceGenDiphotonProduction=True


When you have your trees ready, then the normalization per benchmark is the following:
Sum_over_all_events (weight * benchmark_reweight_Num)/1.06


This sum has to be obtained from the genAnalyzer tree that you have now in your root files. This genanalyzer trees has all DoubleHTagCategories plus NoTag category that includes all events that fail preselection (including the Dalitz Decays that we dont have at the preselection and thats why we multiply the cross section by 1.06 (it is inside cross_section file in flashgg and is multiplied automatically). Now since the Dalitz decays are included at the gen level (as they should, but we still multiplied them b y 1.06) you need to divide you sum by 1.06 (just to cancel this factor out). Just make sure that when you prepare this sum you include all categories in the GenAnalyzer tree including NoTag one.
So in summary, this way you can do it on your final trees, ensuring there are no bugs/failed job or anything else propagated.
This is the proper way to do it, I am sorry if you find this annoying, but I would really prefer to stick to something that is actually the correct way to propagate it . I hope that's fine.",True,{}

yes, of course.
Right now as I explained to Lata, all nodes are present in 2016 and 2017. And 2018 is missing node_3, I will update that in the coming days. But if you do the normalization as I described that should work fine even if you run on all nodes but the histogram was made with less.  Once I will add the missing node, I do not expect to have any changes in those histograms, since they are done at the gen level and this will not change as we now have all nodes.

as I explained we designed the weighting procedure is designed in such a
way that if you miss in the numerator some of the files that you used in
the denominator your reweighting is wrong and cannot be cured by a
simple normalization factor. Lata have shown such an example in the last
slide of the plot. So it is critically important to indicate always what
is in the normalisation file. I invite you to try the experience of Lata
to use or not the node_3 and to see that you shape changes not only the
normalization.

 Dear Maxime,

 yes, of course.

 Right now as I explained to Lata, all nodes are present in 2016 and
 2017. And 2018 is missing node_3, I will update that in the coming
 days. But if you do the normalization as I described that should work
 fine even if you run on all nodes but the histogram was made with
 less. Once I will add the missing node, I do not expect to have any
 changes in those histograms, since they are done at the gen level and
 this will not change as we now have all nodes.

 Best,
 Nadya

From a first look, your suggestions look most reasonable. Will look more
closely tomorrow and try to update the PR by Thursday including the changes
for the electrons along these lines.

 ***@***.**** requested changes on this pull request.

 I think this is very useful. I have some suggestion for the actual
 implementation to make it more transparent.
 I'm not sure that the bits of code I wrote down actually works, but we
 should go for something along those lines.

I am making this PR to update the 2018 GTs according to the latest PPD recommendation. But before you merge I need to clear a few points.

For 2018 Data, GTs work perfectly.
For 2018 MC, the v20 2018 shows the error [1] when I try to run on 2018 mircoAODs so, for now, I have kept it v19 (from link [2], it shows that only uncertainty changes between v19 and v20 mc tag, central values are same).

The problem with v20 also was reported at [3] in December so I preferred to stick with v19. If you find that v19 is good then GTs are correct but if we need to go with v20 then could you please help me fix the error?
Thanks,

@panwarlsweet As HIG conveners said, you should study the effect on the retraining. However, concerning the code, the retraining part is irrelevant. Here I gave the comments that are imperative to have the code self-consistent.  And it is needless to say that the code must be self-consistent to be merged in the master branch. The code will not be merged unless the variables are used in a consistent way, e.g as it is done with DNN-regression, and everything else that was developed for flashgg.
The small improvement of Mjj resolution might not have an effect on anything else, but if this will eventually be included in the publication, the regressed Mjj must be used for calculation of the variables depending on it.  I believe it should take around 30 min to implement those changes and check everything.",True,{}

The changes you propose would have a cosmetic effect and require retraining of the MVA's. Please let me know when you perform this retraining and I would be happy to create an other PR for the changes you have mentioned.

@panwarlsweet As HIG conveners said, you should study the effect on the retraining. However, concerning the code, the retraining part is irrelevant. Here I gave the comments that are imperative to have the code self-consistent. And it is needless to say that the code must be self-consistent to be merged in the master branch. The code will not be merged unless the variables are used in a consistent way, e.g as it is done with DNN-regression, and everything else that was developed for flashgg.
The small improvement of Mjj resolution might not have an effect on anything else, but if this will eventually be included in the publication, the regressed Mjj must be used for calculation of the variables depending on it. I believe it should take around 30 min to implement those changes and check everything.

@chernyavskaya this PR is done in a self-consistent way. What you suggest, needs new training and categorization with corrected Mjj and MX.
Note, conveners did not ask us about retraining [1]. Instead, they are willing to keep L2 integration without retraining. It is a totally minor effect on training and categorization using corrected MX and Mjj.
This PR we have made to study the improvement with existing training and categorization. We don't think it is the correct way to have a training file with uncorrected MX and Mjj and fill MVA output and do categorization using corrected MX and Mjj.
When you have new set of training files, we could make the changes you have suggested with another PR.

to be clear the approval flag was raised for the changes requested previously, this discussion on including Mjj in the MX calculation is not related to that. I also agree that in case the Mjj regression is used and have no sizable impact on the categorization one should apply it consistently to avoid having to describe two different variables in the paper. This again is a point to be decided on the analysis side that will then need to be reflected in the code pushed by the this PR.

Hi Ed,
I share your opinion. All this is negligible.
The point I xould like to make is that this PR is fully scientifically consistent and maximally optimal given the training we have now:

Mjj*C_L2 is used in the likelihood where it improves the result.
Mjj is used in the MVA output calculation consistently with the training.

This can be trivially explained in the text: ""For the likelihood calculation Mjj*C_L2 was used."" But since as you said it is a negligible effect this sentence can be also skipped.
============
What is proposed is to add on top of the wording ""inconsistency"" a second scientific inconsistency:

Mjj*C_L2 is used in the likelihood where it improves the result.
Mjj*C_L2 is used in the MVA output calculation while the training was done with Mjj.

We would have to write then in the paper: ""The variable Mjj was used for MVA training, and Mjj*C_L2 for MVA output calculation"". That may puzzle the reader.

Hi Simone,
Indeed for CMS we are trying to switch to something that has been under discussion for a while to have the S+S available from the database, and took a first step for this.
However at this stage this might be a pain for FLASHgg given that the underlying EnergyScaleCorrection class is also different. Hence like for UL17, will commit the UL18 files in the old format so no other changes are needed in flashGG. Will open a PR with the UL18 MetaConditions having this S+S and keep updating it with the other ingredients.
Thanks,
Rajdeep",True,{}

Thanks for this information. I see that you think that the ES variables might be responsible for EE discrepancy, though it seems to be fairly low priority features looking at @Prasant1993 's slide 12 here https://indico.cern.ch/event/996680/contributions/4208099/attachments/2179705/3681731/Update_XGBoost_TMVA_BDT_UL2018_prasant.pdf . I guess Prasant and @JunquanTao  would already have the Data-MC comparisons of these variables from Z->ee and Z->MuMuG. So we can check from there the degree of discrepancy in these.

Comments on the ReReco 2016 low-pT muon ID SFs
The json file for 2016 ReReco low-pT muon ID SFs is also updated. It is noticed that there are 'key error' messages because the following two json files has different keys for eta bins:
Muon2016_RunBCDEFGH_SF_ID.json
Muon2016_RunBCDEFGH_SF_ID_lowPt.json
To address the issue, a mapping between eta bins and finer eta bins is considered [7] and another json files is created, which is named as Muon2016_RunBCDEFGH_SF_ID_lowPt_finerEtaBin.json
A few slight imperfect mapping are listed as follows (""adapted eta bin"" : ""original eta bin""),
""eta:[0.5,0.8]""   :  ""eta:[0,0.9]""
""eta:[0.8,1.2]""   :  ""eta:[0.9,1.2]""
where the eta range of [0.8, 0.9] should follow the scale factors in ""eta:[0,0.9]"" instead of ""eta:[0.9,1.2]"".
Depending on pT, the differences of SFs due to this mismatch are:
pT in range of [10, 20] GeV: <1%
pT in range of [3.75, 4.00] GeV: ~8%
pT in range of [2.00, 10.0] GeV (excluding [3.75, 4.00]): <4%

The analysis aims to use soft-charm tagging on secondary vertices (SV). We hope to include the SV collection with the flavour tagging score included.

add flashgg::SecondaryVertex output class;
include ONNXRuntime package in flashgg setup;
add two modules for inference of ParticleNet scores on SV basis, and include them to standard MicroAOD routine;
write a new collection flashggSVs to the output file;
