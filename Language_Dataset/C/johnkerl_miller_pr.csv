As it stands, each MacPorts port has a maintainer, and it's the maintainer's job to watch for changes to a project and submit the PRs for a project's Portfile.  In this case since I am the current maintainer for miller on MacPorts, I would be watching the project (I'd see when you create the new release tag in Github) and submit appropriately.
But if you'd like to do that yourself, then certainly.

And also (but at your leisure) I'd like to bring up #272 again.
Most MacPorts users aren't affected by this because fortunately, the MacPorts build infrastructure is using a non-cutting-edge version of XCode, so MacPorts can build miller packages that everyone else can download.

Avoid some data-copies -- having lots of little mallocs (even with bounded heap) doesn't work as well in Go as in C.
Idea is for z = x + y, instead of func MlrvalPlus(input1, input2 *Mlrval) Mlrval, do func MlrvalPlus(output, input1, input2 *Mlrval) where the output space is pre-allocated for each relevant CST node.
Details

With GC enabled: there is lots of GC
With GC off: still lots of duffcopy and madvise taking CPU cycles
From benchmark u/mand.mlr: issue is allocation created by expressions

Things like type BinaryFunc func(input1 *Mlrval, input2 *Mlrval) (output Mlrval)
z = 2 + x + 4 + y * 3 results in AST, mapped to a CST, with a malloc on the output of every unary/binary/ternary function
Idea: replace with type BinaryFunc func(output* Mlrval, input1 *Mlrval, input2 *Mlrval): no allocation at all.

Breaks the Fibonacci test since the binary-operator node is no longer re-entrant


Idea: replace with type BinaryFunc func(input1 *Mlrval, input2 *Mlrval) (output *Mlrval): better.

Makes possible zero-copy eval of literal nodes, etc.

additional libraries to give good timezone support it's capable of

The project is Miller and the executable name is mlr. Which goes back years (to the beginning in 2015) and I should not break people's expectations. (If I had it to do all over again I would have given the tool one name, not two ... but at this point I don't want to break expectations/branding.)
If I use module github.com/johnkerl/miller in go.mod, then go build produces an executable named miller not mlr -- this is a hard stop for me :(

Another is to use module github.com/johnkerl/miller but insist that people type go build mlr.go instead of go build -- which I think will be error-prone
A third is to have some rename-rule in a makefile renaming miller to mlr -- also error-prone, and would require people to step outside of go build
A fourth is rename the repo entirely to github.com/johnkerl/mlr (or make a new github.com/miller/mlr) -- seems like an intimidatingly big step ... :^/

On UNIX/Linux you could consider creating a symbolic link of mlr to miller during the install. (ln -sv /bin/miller /bin/mlr for example) Not sure if this works for Windows though, might need some other method there.

Thanks,

Approximately 40% runtime improvement for large files.
Implementation details
Up until this point in the Go port we were doing a syscall.write on every record. This is too frequently: every system call has the overhead of a context-switch into the kernel, along with the overhead of the Go runtime's syscall wrapper.
On this PR we do the following:

If output is to the terminal, continue to do so by default.
If output is to a pipe or file, write less often (nominally every some number of kilobytes) by default.
Note that both default behaviors are standard in Unix/Linux tools.
Offer the --fflush flag from the C port, along with --no-fflush: the former means flush after every record, whether the output is to a terminal or file/pipe; the latter is to flush less often, whether the output is to a terminal or file/pipe.

Additional technical detail:

C's stdio including printf et al. is buffered; Go's fmt.Fprintf et al. is not.
Up to this point in the Go port I was using a bytes.Buffer along with *os.File, accumulating full-record strings and then osfile.Write(buffer.Bytes()).
On this PR I am taking a simpler approach, using bufio.Writer to do the buffering.

Performance details

Input file ~/tmp/big.csv is the 10-record example.csv but with its data lines repeated 100,000x for a total of a million lines.
10 iterations of mlr --csv cat ~/tmp/big.csv | wc -l were applied with and without this PR applied.

On #779 (https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/blame/main/internal/pkg/types/mlrmap.go#L61) two days ago I left hashRecords=true experimentally for a while.

The Miller 6 Go port didn't go far enough (until now) on #151, namely, for just-in-time type-inferencing.
Recent performance analysis has shown that the implementation was spending too much time detecting string/int/float contents for fields. E.g. reading CSV data like
color,shape,flag,k,index,quantity,rate
yellow,triangle,true,1,11,43.6498,9.8870
...

each value was being scanned and detected as string/int/float. This was taking needless CPU cycles.
On this PR the existing MT_PENDING type (heretofore used only for JSON-scanner intermediates) is moved to the fore. Now, CSV values (and DKVP, NIDX, XTAB, etc.) have their string representations retained but their type set to MT_PENDING. Then, just in time, and when needed, they are inferred. For example, imagine a 20-column CSV, and mlr --csv --from thatfile.csv put $distance = $rate * $time. Before, all 20 columns of all rows were being type-inferred; now, only the two columns rate and time are type-inferred, and the rest are passed along as-was.
JSON processing, however, does not benefit from this gain: intrinsically to the JSON file format, we're required to type-infer all values, whether they are used in the processing chain or not.
Performance results
As of this PR, along with precedings #765, #774, #779, and #781, Miller 6 throughput regularly beats or exceeds Miller 5.

This is for #922 and #438.","I prefer to use tsvlite because of it simplicity. My definition of tsvlite is: fields can contain everything apart from TAB or newline chars. TAB is the field separator. Everything in between is part of the field (i.e., not quoting, no escape characters, nothing special). This makes the file format easy to output and input from/to different systems. The limitation that fields can not contain tabs and newlines was never a big issue.
I have some issues with the new TSV implementation:
First of all, the --tsvlite flag is gone, so I need to change my scripts. Would have preferred if the flag was kept for backward compatibility.
The bigger issue is the new handling of \t \n \ . Is there a way to disable it? For example I might have files which contain Windows file paths with backslashes. This causes some quite unexpected behaviour.

Release notes
Sourced from actions/cache's releases.

v3.0.0


This change adds a minimum runner version(node12 -> node16), which can break users using an out-of-date/fork of the runner. This would be most commonly affecting users on GHES 3.3 or before, as those runners do not support node16 actions and they can use actions from github.com via github connect or manually copying the repo to their GHES instance.


Few dependencies and cache action usage examples have also been updated.


v2.1.7
Support 10GB cache upload using the latest version 1.0.8 of @actions/cache 
v2.1.6

Catch unhandled ""bad file descriptor"" errors that sometimes occurs when the cache server returns non-successful response (actions/cache#596)

v2.1.5

Fix permissions error seen when extracting caches with GNU tar that were previously created using BSD tar (actions/cache#527)

v2.1.4

Make caching more verbose #650
Use GNU tar on macOS if available #701

v2.1.3

Upgrades @actions/core to v1.2.6 for CVE-2020-15228. This action was not using the affected methods.
Fix error handling in uploadChunk where 400-level errors were not being detected and handled correctly

v2.1.2

Adds input to limit the chunk upload size, useful for self-hosted runners with slower upload speeds
No-op when executing on GHES

v2.1.1

Update @actions/cache package to v1.0.2 which allows cache action to use posix format when taring files.

v2.1.0

Replaces the http-client with the Azure Storage SDK for NodeJS when downloading cache content from Azure.  This should help improve download performance and reliability as the SDK downloads files in 4 MB chunks, which can be parallelized and retried independently
Display download progress and speed

Replaces the http-client with the Azure Storage SDK for NodeJS when downloading cache content from Azure.  This should help improve download performance and reliability as the SDK downloads files in 4 MB chunks, which can be parallelized and retried independently
Display download progress and speed

Release notes
Sourced from actions/setup-go's releases.

v3.0.0
What's Changed

Update default runtime to node16 (actions/setup-go#192)
Update package-lock.json file version to 2 (actions/setup-go#193) and @types/node to 16.11.25 (actions/setup-go#194)
Remove the stable input and fix SemVer notation (actions/setup-go#195)

Breaking Changes
With the update to Node 16, all scripts will now be run with Node 16 rather than Node 12.
This new major release removes the stable input, so there is no need to specify additional input to use pre-release versions. This release also corrects the pre-release versions syntax to satisfy the SemVer notation (1.18.0-beta1 -> 1.18.0-beta.1, 1.18.0-rc1 -> 1.18.0-rc.1).
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - uses: actions/setup-go@v3
    with:
      go-version: '1.18.0-rc.1' 
  - run: go version
Add check-latest input
In scope of this release we add the check-latest input. If check-latest is set to true, the action first checks if the cached version is the latest one. If the locally cached version is not the most up-to-date, a Go version will then be downloaded from go-versions repository. By default check-latest is set to false.
Example of usage:
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - uses: actions/setup-go@v2
    with:
      go-version: '1.16'
      check-latest: true
  - run: go version
Moreover, we updated @actions/core from 1.2.6 to 1.6.0
v2.1.5
In scope of this release we updated matchers.json  to improve the problem matcher pattern. For more information please refer to this pull request
v2.1.4
What's Changed

Fix extractor selection on windows by @​paulcacheux in actions/setup-go#141

New Contributors

@​paulcacheux made their first contribution in actions/setup-go#141

Full Changelog: actions/setup-go@v2.1.3...v2.1.4
v2.1.3

Updated communication with runner to use environment files rather then workflow commands

v2.1.2
This release includes vendored licenses for this action's npm dependencies.

v1.0.6
v1.0.6 - 20 Apr 2022
[Miscellaneous]
  * Minimum go version is now go 1.13
  * github.com/pkg/errors is going to be phased out in steps. In this release,
    users may opt-in to using native errors using `fmt.Errorf(""%w"")` by
    specifying the tag `strftime_native_errors`. In the next release, the default
    will be to use native errors, but users will be able to opt-in to using
    github.com/pkg/errors using a tag. The version after will remove github.com/pkg/errors.
This is something that we normally would do over a major version upgrade
but since we do not expect this library to receive API breaking changes in the
near future and thus no v2 is expected, we have decided to do this over few
non-major releases.
