No. It will split the amount you want for the asset you want

Just an idea but I'm not sure a readme is the best format for this, we (HyperDEX Team) have a LOT of detailed requests and ideas on how things should be implemented. Some of which have already been created in the form of issues.
Maybe in the readme we could put a small summary of each change we see necessary and why, then a link to an issue for further discussion?
That way this document serves as a brief overview and you can navigate to a specific issue you're interested in for more detail or further discussion.
We already have a few issues open but there are way more things we've discussed internally

This is a backwards compatible change, default behaviour is identical.
# ./m_notary will result in the same iguana command as before this PR:
$ ./m_notary
# results in:
stdbuf -oL ../agents/iguana notary

# However you can now change the `notary` option to whatever you want:
$ ./m_notary """" notary_nosplit
# results in:
stdbuf -oL ../agents/iguana notary_nosplit

This is just a short term fix. I think in the long run we should split the ./m_notary functionality out into multiple scripts with a single purpose.
I don't think it makes sense to have a single script that:

kills the currently running daemon
checks out a hardcoded branch
git pulls
builds
launches the daemon
sends it a load of setup requests

Those are all separate tasks and they shouldn't be combined.","This allows people to pass custom arguments to iguana without having to fork and maintain their own repo and keep it up to date with upstream.
This is a backwards compatible change, default behaviour is identical.
# ./m_notary will result in the same iguana command as before this PR:
$ ./m_notary
# results in:
stdbuf -oL ../agents/iguana notary

# However you can now change the `notary` option to whatever you want:
$ ./m_notary """" notary_nosplit
# results in:
stdbuf -oL ../agents/iguana notary_nosplit

This is just a short term fix. I think in the long run we should split the ./m_notary functionality out into multiple scripts with a single purpose.
I don't think it makes sense to have a single script that:

kills the currently running daemon
checks out a hardcoded branch
git pulls
builds
launches the daemon
sends it a load of setup requests

Those are all separate tasks and they shouldn't be combined.",True,{}

Can I make a suggestion that git pull isn't hardcoded into the build process? Seems like it should be three separate steps to me:

Update source (git pull)
Build from source
Run binary

There are time when I may want to do any one of these three steps individually without the other. I may want to git pull without building, and I may want to build at the current commit without pulling the latest changes.
