In practice, the performance increase is currently quite modest in cases where the main bottleneck is mixing in short sections (see #834); however, many processor implementations are now at least simpler, and further optimisations should be possible. Also, many performance-critical sections are now optimised for SSE2/SSE4.1. Finally, signal processing now works without explicit clearing of buffers, which fixes #821.",True,{}
