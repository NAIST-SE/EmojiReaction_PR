Comments appreciated.","Hello there, I had not touched this until recently when I upgraded my distro and noticed this feature did not work anymore.
@Arnavion regarding scoping of the queue, I tried to do it with this new patch, but I lose the global behavior. https://gist.github.com/etrunko/c6a38e5b84227e06e092a16e7df5fe67
For instance if I have more than one server connected, and close a channel in one server, then focus on another channel of a different server, it will not restore the closed tab. I need to focus again on that other server and hit Ctrl+Shift+Tab to get that channel back open.
My idea is to reopen the last channel closed, independently of which server is focused, so I think it makes more sense to keep it global, but if you don't like the static declaration, I could easily put it under another struct, not sure which one though. Because there is no such thing as a maingui struct, I thought it would not make sense to do it like that.

Comments appreciated.","Well, for me it is something intrinsic to any GUI application which has tabs, such as web browsers, terminal emulators and chat applications. All of them support Ctrl+w and Crtl+Shift+t shortcuts, and that is really what this is all about, shortcuts. /close and other commands are really for people who know how to use IRC, and the user interface should provide the ways for people who are not aware those commands. For instance, I can easily change my nickname with /nick, but it is also possible to do it by clicking on the button on the main window. Hexchat itself supports Ctrl+t for a new tab, so I think it makes perfect sense to provide shortcuts for closing and ""unclosing"" tabs.
I wonder what really holds this change to be merged as is, and as I had already asked before, please provide me with pointers about what should be improved/changed to get this code in, so I can get rid of maintaining a separate branch and building manually.",True,"{'THUMBS_UP': ['https://github.com/joeykrim', 'https://github.com/Polsaker']}"

Don't migrate at all; It really isn't that hard to do a one time setup and it is impossible to have a complete full migration so why half-ass it.
Have a slightly more interactive migration process.

I'm submitting this PR early just to probe for opinions about it, even if I don't consider this finished yet.
Often I end up sending messages by mistake, for example because I think another window have focus, or because I write in the wrong channel.. Since I usually lurk on several channels, and I rarely interact, I wanted an option to disable text input on certain channels on my choose, so that it become impossible to send messages by mistake (unless you disable that option, of course :) )
This PR introduces the ""lurk mode"" in channel settings, so that the input box became not editable when the option is active.
I would like to make this a bit better, for example making the input box grey when in lurk mode, and/or make the channel name grey for channels in lurk mode.. Also, I haven't taken care of saving this settings in the config files yet.. But as I said I'm looking for early comments about this :)","I dig the concept/idea, but I personally would not use it just because I, and most people I know, use monitor buffers/windows via script.

This is probably related to how the compiler is dealing with the strings rather than anything else. All strings in GTK are UTF-8 and any interaction with Windows does convert to UTF-16 for those APIs.

GTK expects you to give utf-8 strings. If you give it non-utf8 strings there's no defined behavior what happens. In this case it appears to use them verbotem, but it doesn't matter.

If we want to replace the reference to DISPLAY_NAME to something else, there already exists a msgid ""HexChat"" which can be used for this purpose that seems to have a few localized names.
Looking at screenshots of arabic language OSs it seems that the truncation of window titles is inconsistent from what I can find.  However if we assume RTL window naming and truncation on the left instead of the right, even without placing "" - HexChat"" at the end HexChat already produces output that places the nick and network name on the right by way of its ordering of arguments.
This can be fixed in the individual .po files for the languages needing them by providing the position of the argument in the translated msgstr in the form of %n$ as per https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#c_002dformat

My assumption is nearly no translators know that format and to use it they would have to modify dozens of lines. I probably don't know a better solution without allocating a newly formatted string everywhere though.

I don't know a better solution either, this seemed the simplest while fitting with the gettext documentation for how arguments should be reordered.  As their documentation states:

Although format strings with positions that reorder arguments [...] are a POSIX/XSI feature and not specified by ISO C 99, translators can rely on this reordering ability: On the few platforms where printf(), fprintf() etc. don’t support this feature natively, libintl.a or libintl.so provides replacement functions, and GNU <libintl.h> activates these replacement functions automatically.

So hopefully anyone wanting to translate into a right-to-left language would already be aware of this.  Failing that, there are only a small number of right to left languages (none of which HexChat has localization for at current) and it may be simplest to make that change there after translation work is done, since it is only the title that needs be moved.",True,{}

Re doat, I could make it call fe_ctrl_gui instead but then I'd have to
re-implement parts of the cmd_doat function so I'd prefer to keep it
as-is. I cannot call cmd_doat directly because it is a static function
so only works when called from outbound.c.

I indeed hadn't tested it, fixed the issue now.

What I was trying to say was turn the fish functions into a static_library() in the meson file and use that for the tests and the plugin thus reducing the unnecessary duplication, then run tests with test(). Looking at it now I realize it wasn't even a real test so I guess that confused me... I guess you can just delete it but real tests would be nice.
This doesn't need to be an out of tree plugin.
Also I realize its not an issue you introduced so I won't block on it but BakasuraRCE/hexchat-fishlim-reloaded#1 would be nice to resolve.",True,{'THUMBS_UP': ['https://github.com/BakasuraRCE']}

Since I can't reproduce it consistently (only about ~20% of the time), I suspect it's a race condition between generating headers in ""common"" and building ""fe-gtk"".
This PR makes fe-gtk require the generated headers as 'sources'.
I've been chasing this for a while now (it's been problematic for NetBSD's bulk package builds) and have tried various things that reduced the failure rate - this seems closest to a correct fix, but it's hard for me to tell due to difficulty reproducing and unfamiliarity with meson.","I'm staring at this build error:

interest us. This becomes more relevant in distros like Ubuntu, where
snaps are a thing, and each snap mounts their own FS in a squashfs that
is always full, thus falsifying the output of sysinfo.
Some other things to consider, where I haven't found a good solution yet: ZFS. On my desktop, I have a ZFS array for data storage, and that makes the df-output go a little crazy and yield very wrong results, which would require significantly more complex parsing and detection. Example:
Filesystem                        Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
desktop-zfs-crypt/misc            510G  133M  510G   1% /home/simon/misc

desktop-zfs-crypt/desktop-backup  974G  465G  510G  48% /desktop-backup

These numbers are all a bit off because ""Size"" is ""what space is available in total for this file system"". If you don't set quotas on the ZFS volumes, they all ""share"" the full capacity of the entire zpool, which technically has a much smaller capacity:
NAME                SIZE  ALLOC   FREE  CKPOINT  EXPANDSZ   FRAG    CAP  DEDUP    HEALTH  ALTROOT

One way that could work would be also excluding zfs, attempting to figure out if the zfs and zpool binaries are on the path, and then getting the size of those pools that way. Though I'm not sure if that is worth the effort.","Generally, how much space we have in squashfs, or tmpfs shouldn't

The script is not a big script (to see Main()) :
The first part of the script install the environment  to build (install librairies from brew only if is needed and environment variables (LD_PATH...) only if is need (like brew version of gettext or openssl that not linked with /usr/local/lib by default)
The second part call meson and ninja
The Thrid part make the bundles of hexchat.app and hexchat-portable.app
There are a few lines codes for patch some details.
It was the first time that i use meson and i spent a lot of days to understand how build, read documentation , understand that jhbuild is a old process for build it.
I taked the choice for don't touch the exiting code or meson.build files because i am not an expert and i don't want to maintain after ;)
But if you want i can explain to you which modifications is needed into the meson.build file for remove the patch lines of the script.
So if you can add this Script V1 into your tree could be nice. For me for the future release, and maybe for another people but that script and the portable bundle needs to be tested by someone else.
Also the part in the OSX folder of your tree (to make the OSX bundle) is Out of date if i understand because that continue to use jhbuild Right ?

My Build is there : 2.14.3 OSX Catalina","OK no problem i can move it under the OSX folder. For the moment i have 2 works to do to make a really portable version :

First is understand (because for the moment i don't understand lol) how to put the share folder in relative of the main binairy path for example .. (e.g. support of multi-language .po)
Second is put the model of the script Launcher of ""GIMP"" to make a very full portable version (include, python environment variables and binaries, start service like dbus .....)

I have patch the trouble of lua big usage memory. The problem was it : In OSX 64bit the default pagezero_size is 64GB, and you have to fixit on the link command of the main binary only (option don't support for a .dylib but just the final binary (with main -Wl,-pagezero_size,0x10000) ). But maybe someone could be fixit on the src meson.build ?
So when the dbus service is running, you can see the icon on the title bar but if you open the window, when the widows is closed the application crash:
/applications/HExChat.app/Contents/MacOS$ hexchat

(hexchat:29295): libnotify-WARNING **: 12:27:27.034: Failed to connect to proxy
Segmentation fault: 11




If the trouble is not again fixed on the master branch, if you explain me how to active supply of log messages report to you.
And a last thing, because i check how to fix-it but i think GTK2.0 don't support Hi resolution Screen like Macbook Retina, so .... a new version with GTK3.0 in your basket ?

My Build is there : 2.14.3 OSX Catalina","@philicious Hi,
OK Nice news.
You can Find my Build there: 2.14.3 OSX Catalina
To Help me, after download my build, launch the application with a terminal session like :
/Applications/hexchat.app/Contents/MacOS$ hexchat
And give me all the printed lines
A Friend have tried to run it on Mojave and for the moment there are troubles.
But i can try, with you, to resolv it if you want.
The problem is this:
dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: _objc_opt_class
  Referenced from: /Applications/hexchat.app/Contents/Resources/lib/libgdk-quartz-2.0.0.dylib (which was built for Mac OS X 10.15)
  Expected in: /usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib

The Librairies of /usr/lib is not include in the bundle like libobjc.A.dylib
BUT if you have GIMP.app you can try it for me:
do it under : /Applications/hexchat.app/Contents/
ln -s ./Resources/lib .
and put the  ......./GIMP.app/Contents/Resources/lib/libgdk-quartz-2.0.0.dylib  into your
/Applications/hexchat.app/Contents/lib/

If you have again a problem with another GTK+ lib, do the same thing.
And Tell me more ;)

It took me 50 tries, but I finally managed to run a complete run, on both x86 and x64 and create the artifacts.
This build system is 2 times slower (take 4 minutes for each build run, compared to ~2 minutes with appveyor) and the artifact for the build directory is about 4 times the size (~120MB compared to ~30MB).
Also, I changed the installer file name as space is an invalid character in an artifact name.

So this is where things get messy.
Firstly we need to rebase our custom patches. It has been a very long time so I think this is the correct branch: https://github.com/hexchat/gvsbuild/commits/hexchat-fixes-2 (they can be upstreamed too, they weren't because I think the patches were specific to a single VS version)
Secondly build everything hexchat specifically needs. I'm not sure Its documented anywhere but I believe it is just openssl gtk2 lgi. You can see https://dl.hexchat.net/gtk/ for the expected contents and you can just upload your results somewhere. And of course test hexchat against it.
Thirdly if you want to be a true hero you could get gvsbuild automatically building what we need with CI, ideally with Github Actions, or by extending upstreams support (https://github.com/wingtk/gvsbuild/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml).

i think that's beside the point here. this is more correct by the protocol and allows for a server to tell you that you are attempting SASL EXTERNAL without providing the information it wants to use to verify you, usually a client certificate.
the concept of ""SASL EXTERNAL"" is that the server decides which external information to use for authentication. it could be host-based, it could be which port you are connecting on, it could be absolutely anything.",True,{}

Based on the spec I'm reading this seems like a requirement.

The tag MUST be added by the ircd to all commands sent by a user (e.g. PRIVMSG, MODE, NOTICE, and all others). The tag also MUST be added by the ircd to all numerics directly caused by the sender.

(If the user is not identified to any services account, the tag MUST NOT be sent.)

instead. This might use libproxy, or not, as appropriate.
P.S. This removes a memory safety issue because proxy_list is allocated
using malloc(), not g_malloc(), and therefore using g_strfreev() is
incorrect. The proper way to free the proxy list returned by libproxy
is to use px_proxy_factory_free_proxies() (but nobody does that because
it was added in libproxy 0.4.16, which is somewhat recent).

This color priority order is normally handled by logic in fe_print_text, but when plugins emit messages, the tab state provided to fe_print_text is unconditionally overwritten by the tab state corresponding to the color provided to the most recent call to fe_set_tab_color for a session (via sess->last_tab_state).

This color priority order is normally handled by logic in fe_print_text, but when plugins emit messages, the tab state provided to fe_print_text is unconditionally overwritten by the tab state corresponding to the color provided to the most recent call to fe_set_tab_color for a session (via sess->last_tab_state). If a plugin eats all message events, it will invariably be the NEW_DATA color, since fe_print_text sets NEW_DATA if no higher-priority tab color exists.
Plugins can reliably set the tab color via the GUI COLOR command, but doing so bypasses the priority system for tab colors. To remedy this, we add an -NOOVERRIDE parameter which can be appended to a normal GUI COLOR [0-3] command, to signal that we should apply the same rules for tab coloring as ""normal"" message handling. This is implemented internally as a bit flag (8) which is added to the provided highlight color (0-3). That is to say, if we run /GUI COLOR 2 -NOOVERRIDE, but the tab we're coloring already has a new highlight (COLOR 3), the tab remains colored as a new highlight.
For backwards compatibility, -NOOVERRIDE must come after the color parameter. Scripts which don't need backwards compatibility can add the flag value directly.

In practice, I would find this bug intermittently with my Lua bookmarks plugin; I found the above plugin to be a consistent way to duplicate the problem.
When this plugin is loaded into HexChat right now, the plugin will print something like this:

Notice that the keys stop printing after 52, and that there's corruption for what should be key_53. By looking at the memory of a running HexChat, I realized that the buffer used to iterate over hexchat.pluginprefs using pairs was being GC'd by Lua. This would sometimes cause corruption w/ my bookmarks plugin, but deliberately printing lots of strings that aren't used gave me an easy way to always overwrite the buffer used for listing the key/values of hexchat.pluginprefs.
The pairs function in Lua actually returns 3 values: A closure that describes how to iterate, the data you wish to iterate over (""state""), and a start value. Because of how Lua works, you can return 2 or 1 values from your pairs implementation for C code (the __pairs metamethod) and things should still work. However, it appears that Lua GC's the buffer we use to hold the state of iterating over hexchat.pluginprefs immediately if we don't return that buffer as well. This PR returns that buffer back to Lua to prevent immediate GC'ing.
With my PR, the contrived plugin iterates to completion, and I can confirm that Lua preserves the buffer and allocates memory around it:

The serv->password field is always filled out using the safe_strcpy function like this:

         Line 3524

      2638c88
    
  
  
    

        
          
           safe_strcpy (serv->password, net->pass, sizeof (serv->password)); 
        
    
  


This ensures that the string inside serv->password is always sizeof(serv->password) characters long (currently 86) and null-terminated. Thus making checks like strlen (serv->password) != 0🡭 and strchr (serv->password, ' ')🡭 somewhat safer later on.
Now, the only times serv->password is actually used (and possibly copied somewhere) is inside encode_pass_sasl_plain()

  
    
      hexchat/src/common/inbound.c
    
    
         Line 1916
      in
      2638c88
    
  
  
    

        
          
           pass = encode_sasl_pass_plain (user, serv->password);

           response = challengeauth_response (user, serv->password, word[5]); 
        
    
  


Inside both of those functions the field ends up handled via GLib functions like g_strdup_printf() and g_strndup(), which could reasonably be expected to handle the new suggested length of the field (1024) gracefully.
Most importantly, I didn't find any more buffers of static length that this field is copied into down the line, which means that hopefully nothing will get overflown.
Possible further enhancements

Define all arbitrary constants like this separately and use them in checks like strnlen instead of relying on strlen and null-terminatedness. Seeing how strlen is used liberally throughout the source at this time, I don't think it's very practical to do this for one specific field.
Let go of arbitrary length restrictions. Lots of added dynamic memory management business. Probably not worth it at this point.

Motivation
Some IRC servers and IRC bouncer deployments are known to require long generated tokens to be provided in the place of a SASL password. One of such installations is the soju bouncer instance deployed at chat.sr.ht, which authenticates users with a long OAuth2 token. This case was mentioned in the original issue, and it's potentially blocking for a few hundred users.
The new maximum length of 1024 characters for the server password was originally suggested by @ddevault, an admin at said instance.","This might look like a careless hack, but I did poke around the source code enough to make sure it was really that simple.

The serv->password field is always filled out using the safe_strcpy function like this:

  
    
      hexchat/src/common/outbound.c
    
    
         Line 3524
      in
      2638c88
    
  
  
    

        
          
           safe_strcpy (serv->password, net->pass, sizeof (serv->password)); 
        
    
  


This ensures that the string inside serv->password is always sizeof(serv->password) characters long (currently 86) and null-terminated. Thus making checks like strlen (serv->password) != 0🡭 and strchr (serv->password, ' ')🡭 somewhat safer later on.
Now, the only times serv->password is actually used (and possibly copied somewhere) is inside encode_pass_sasl_plain()

  
    
      hexchat/src/common/inbound.c
    
    
         Line 1916
      in
      2638c88
    
  
  
    

        
          
           pass = encode_sasl_pass_plain (user, serv->password); 
        
    
  


and challengeauth_response().

  
    
      hexchat/src/common/proto-irc.c
    
    
         Line 1244
      in
      2638c88
    
  
  
    

        
          
           response = challengeauth_response (user, serv->password, word[5]); 
        
    
  


Inside both of those functions the field ends up handled via GLib functions like g_strdup_printf() and g_strndup(), which could reasonably be expected to handle the new suggested length of the field (1024) gracefully.
Most importantly, I didn't find any more buffers of static length that this field is copied into down the line, which means that hopefully nothing will get overflown.
Possible further enhancements

Define all arbitrary constants like this separately and use them in checks like strnlen instead of relying on strlen and null-terminatedness. Seeing how strlen is used liberally throughout the source at this time, I don't think it's very practical to do this for one specific field.
Let go of arbitrary length restrictions. Lots of added dynamic memory management business. Probably not worth it at this point.

I do believe that SASL, as-is, will fail if your password is too long, as it will go beyond the length of an IRC message. The spec covers how to split these lines. https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/sasl-3.1#the-authenticate-command",True,{}
