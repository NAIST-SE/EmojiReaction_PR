Gamma (vid_gamma cvar), intensity (gl3_intensity cvar, makes textures look more intense and brighter) and overbrightbits (gl3_overbrightbits cvar, lets you adjust darkness of shadows) are applied in the shader and can be changed in realtime (without vid_restart or anything, just change the cvars).

Dynamic lights are also applied via shader and thus are not limited to the lightmap resolution and look smoother
Dynamic lights now should work on all brush based entities. In the old renderer they only worked on some doors (and normal walls), but not on rotating things.
Particles look a bit softer, as they fade out towards their edges
Lightmaps look the same, but they are blended in the shader (both onto the base surface texture and with each other in case of dynamic lightmaps, like flickering lights, switchable lights etc)
Screenshots can now be taken in JPG, PNG, BMP (and of course still TGA) format, with both the new and the old renderer. See 9462063 for some details
I tried to keep the code compatible to OpenGL ES3 - but I didn't try that yet. Unfortunately, OpenGL ES2 support (for RPi etc) would be harder, because it lacks UBOs (Uniform Buffer Objects) that I use. Anyway, if anyone wants to port this to mobile platforms or whatever might be using OpenGL ES3, it should be easy.
The code should be mostly cleaner and more straightforward than the old renderer, because it doesn't have special cases depending on what the hardware supports, it only uses things available on all hardware that supports OpenGL3.2.

(To be fair, the worst thing in the GL1 code probably was multitexturing which has already been removed)","Daniel put a lot of work and even more time into this. This new renderer is likely the best ""classic look"" renderer ever written for Quake II. To use it an OpenGL 3.2 compliant GPU is required. Be aware that some drivers - say 'hello' to the Intel Windows driver - are really crappy and slow. In out tests this new renderer is considerably faster than the old OpenGL 1.4 renderer if a strong GPU and a good driver is used. With slow GPUs and bad drivers it may be slightly slower, but in general stays above ~90 FPS. Anti aliasing is somewhat more as expensive than with OpenGL 1.4, mostly due to the use of fragment shaders.
Before this can be merged more testing is required. I'll play through the game at least once. In the medium term (after the merge) some smaller features are still missing:

vid_ref should be renamed to vid_renderer for compatibility with old config files.
Add the renderer selection back to the video menu.
Document all cvars. That's long overdue.
cmake is currently broken.

They're build from this branch plus one missing pull request fixing the item order in the video menu. Since Daniel opened the pull request several bugs were fixed and the look and feel was tweaked to match the removed multitexturing render path of the old OpenGL 1.4 renderer. In fact this new render is much closer to the old renderer with multitexturing than the old renderer with ""classic"" rendering.
Have fun with testing this. :)",True,{}

In the Video menu select the OpenGL 3.2 renderer by pressing your left/right arrow keys, afterwards apply (select apply with down-arrow, then press your Enter key).
The window title will tell you which renderer is currently used.
Ok, so some notes about what this can do:

Gamma (vid_gamma cvar), intensity (gl3_intensity cvar, makes textures look more intense and brighter) and overbrightbits (gl3_overbrightbits cvar, lets you adjust darkness of shadows) are applied in the shader and can be changed in realtime (without vid_restart or anything, just change the cvars). Intensity and overbrightbits used to be limited to integral values or even just 1,2,4; now these can be any decimal value, like 1.5
Dynamic lights are also applied via shader and thus are not limited to the lightmap resolution and look smoother
Dynamic lights now should work on all brush based entities. In the old renderer they only worked on some doors (and normal walls), but not on rotating things.
Particles look a bit softer, as they fade out towards their edges
Lightmaps look the same, but they are blended in the shader (both onto the base surface texture and with each other in case of dynamic lightmaps, like flickering lights, switchable lights etc)
Screenshots can now be taken in JPG, PNG, BMP (and of course still TGA) format, with both the new and the old renderer. See 9462063 for some details
I tried to keep the code compatible to OpenGL ES3 - but I didn't try that yet. Unfortunately, OpenGL ES2 support (for RPi etc) would be harder, because it lacks UBOs (Uniform Buffer Objects) that I use. Anyway, if anyone wants to port this to mobile platforms or whatever might be using OpenGL ES3, it should be easy.

the diff results in a passing build","can you try running the game without installing it?
from the release/ directory where the binaries are located after compiling
you can set the directory the data is in with ./quake2 +set basedir /path/to/quake2/
for Linux we suggest to keep all binaries in the same directory (game.so in the baseq2/ subdirectory next to the executable of course) and then symlinking the executable to /usr/bin/ or whatever is on your $PATH.
For OpenBSD it won't work if it's not possible to get the executable path, so you may need a shellscript in /usr/bin/ that switches to the directory the binaries are in first.",True,{}

maybe step through the Sys_LoadLibrary() call in VID_LoadRefresh(), check if it path is indeed just ""ref_gl1.so""?

note I changed the output to make sure what's used as the path.
Regarding dlopen on OpenBSD the man page states.

The path parameter can be specified as either an absolute pathname to a shared library or just the name of the shared library itself. When an absolute pathname is specified, only the path provided will be searched for the shared library. When just a shared library is specified, the same paths will be searched that are used for “intrinsic” shared library searches.

the string ""ref_gl1.so"" is not an absolute path hence it's not searched for in the current directory. I assume it searches /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib and other places where system wide libs are expected.
Just to test this assumption. I copied the ref_gl1.so and ref_gl3.so to /usr/local/lib and have the game running.",True,{}

the diff results in a passing build","Well, originally the WITH_SYSTEMDIR was meant for game data..
but it's also used to load the game.so (because for mods it kinda is part of the game data)..
and before we put the renderer back into a lib, quake2 was pretty much self-contained (except for game.so)..
and then we added that rpath hack with SYSTEMDIR/lib so one could more easily use a custom libsdl2 (back when it wasn't readily available in most distros)..
and some packages used the systemdir for both game data and binaries..
It's a bit of a mess and I'm not sure yet how best to resolve it without breaking too much stuff.
One reason we want to have all the binaries (esp. quake2 executable and render libs) in the same path (vs looking for render libs in all the places we look for game data) is to make sure people don't just update one part of their q2 installation and report weird bugs.",True,{}

I'm leaning towards agreeing with this proposal. I can repackage yquake2 to place binaries the way you suggest (all in the same directory with game data and .so files) then providing a shell wrapper that will change the current directory to the same one as the binary. I do need however a way to make sure the game will look for everything in /usr/local/share/yquake2/. This seems covered by WITH_SYSTEMDIR but the Sys_BinaryDir change will still be needed for the game to load the .so from the current working directory.
Let me know what you decide and I will act accordingly on our side.",True,{}

A further problem with joystick-like devices is that the axis numbers are not consistent between devices, so hardcoded assumptions about the meaning of axis0 and axis1 (even worse: every further axis) will cause trouble.
So we'd need:

support for at least 6 axes (4 axes for the two analog sticks, and I think that sometimes the controller's DPad is represented as two axes - which axis is which varies per device)
configurable action per axis

forward/backward
strafe left/right
look up/down
turn left/right

Make buttons work in menu and bind actions on buttons: DPAD to navigate, A button to confirm, B button to move to previous menu, START to open/close menu, etc.;

however, some things that could be improved:

I think for Quake2 (and FPS games in general), using the  triggers as axes for movement/looking is not that useful - I guess most people will want to use them like normal buttons, probably for shooting
related: On some (many?) controllers (e.g. PS2-like), the triggers are buttons and thus will probably create two events: one SDL_CONTROLLER_AXIS_TRIGGERLEFT (or RIGHT) event and one SDL_JOYBUTTONDOWN event
some kind of calibration or deadzone support (maybe as ""deadzone start"" and ""deadzone end"" values?) would be useful probably.. but might need UI (menu) support to be usable, which might be quite painful in Quake2. Maybe people can use their operating system for calibration instead..

I have fixed/reverted such:

Fix build with SDL 1.2
Move video modes
Oposite direction on joy_sidesensitivity
Add notes about code reuse from ioquake3
Revert changes in stb_img.h

Not fixed/changed:
@DanielGibson:

""I had to set jaw and pitch sensitivity way down (~0.3) to be able to aim => maybe scale it down a bit by default?""
maximum movement speed seems to be walking speed - should be running speed (at least if ""always run"" is on)

It can be related to controller/joystick - i don't have any universal solutions for it. I have same movement speed with my joystick as with buttons (joystick_forwardmove *= cl_forwardspeed->value;), or like it. Try to change sensitivity to bigger value. Authors of original code base proposed to use separate configuration for each joystick.

""haptic feedback feels inconsistent - shooting (at enemies) rumbles more than being shot, if a parasite (dog-like thing) attacks you, there is no rumbling at all. running (only possible via keyboard, see above) also causes rumbling, it probably shouldn't""

Also can be related to joystick - i have some noname joystick - and i am not sure what will be correct feedback. I can set other value to magnitude and time period for some weapons, if you like. Code also generated feedback for step sound - so running also have some feedback.

""when navigating the menu with the hat the console is spammed with ""HAT_* is unbound, hit F4 to set"" messages - that's uncool (especially in the menu where the hat is actually used)""
""when pressing other unbound keys (even in game), like joy8, no such messages are printed (here it might be useful to bind those keys via console)""

I will try to resolve it in next version.

when navigating in the menu there is no way to go back with the controller (like with Esc on a keyboard)

Maybe add additional line in each menu like ""go back"" ?
@Yamagi:

menu.c: Using the empty lines for the joystick stuff is rather confusing since the options are scattered around. What about replacing lookspring and lookstrafe with the joystick stuff if it's enabled?

Maybe someone like to use lookspring / lookstrafe. If you like i can replace this lines with my ""joystick lines"", or delete ""in_joystick"" at all and move ""haptic"" to end of menu.

Removed fake events for AXIS*_{DOWN,UP}
Changed logic in menu -> If detected hapric capabilities -> lookspring menu item will be replaced by haptic magnitude item.

I just had a look and found only two small problems:

In input.c line 1193 Com_Printf(""------------------------------------\n\n""); should be moved to the bottom of that function. Otherwise some output is not in the ""input block"".
In the options menu the internal order of the elements doesn't match the visible order. That can be seen when scrolling the menu from top to bottom. That's likely caused by adding the menu elements in a wrong order. I would suggest to remove the blank line under ""invert mouse"" and move everything below it one line up. And yes, the menu system is crap. ;)

Otherwise I'm happy. Just one questions: Is there a way to bind axis through the menu? I'm not even sure that the bind system is able to do such thing but it would be nice.

Just one questions: Is there a way to bind axis through the menu?

Off the top of my head - we can do it in such way:

create separate menu where we will set some flag ""bind axis"" before enter and unset after exit of such menu (It will fully hide any additional fake events ralated to axis movement).
inside of such menu we will have rows with ""direction options"" like:

sidemove <leftx>
updown <righty>
......


in inputs.c  if ""bindaxis"" is true - move for axis will produce key_event.

So it will be good candidate for improvements in next PR :-)",True,{}

bottom row of shoulder buttons mapped as shoulder triggers left and right.
When in game using these buttons the unmapped button/key message pops up
for the joy#.
I suspect this might be a problem with SDL. but maybe its worth mentioning.

 SDL hide button events for triggers, so when user clicks trigger button -
 code will receive only trigger axis event. So joysticks(not controllers)
 without trigger axis will never receive any events(trigger button).

 So use joystick events will be more flexible because it provide up to 32
 buttons <https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_JoyButtonEvent> and never hide
 events. Controller can have up to 14 buttons
 <https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GameControllerButton>. Also controller can
 have only 6 axis <https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GameControllerAxis> but if
 user has joystick with bigger amount of axis user can remap it by
 SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG.

 As temporary solution set 'joy_axis_trigger{left,right}' to 'none' and
 bind 'joy#' to actions for triggers.

What to do whith the cvars? Currently all render independent cvars are prefixed with gl_ and render specific cvars with gl1_ or gl3_. Moving the softrenderer into the gl_ namespace would be easiest but feels wrong. Staying with r_ complicates things. Moving the GL renderers back to r_ breaks existing configs...
It would be really nice if at least overbrightbits could be implemented into the softrenderer. It shouldn't be too hard, maybe the GL1 code could be used as a starting point. Some other features added to the GL renderers are support for tga textures and jpeg screenshots.

should be taken when changing (bumping) them.


be careful if you ever want to change MAXWIDTH: 12.20 fixed
point math used in R_ScanEdges() overflows at width 2048.


the screen warp code expects hardcoded 1600x1200 max resolution
instead of using the macros.


I'm attaching two patches here (you can git am them):


first one replaces some (long) casts on pointers with intptr_t,
which is needed for WIN64, because WIN64 is LLP64 and not LP64.


second one changes MAXHEIGHT back to 1200 (because I did a lazy
copy/paste), adds back MAXWIDTH as 1600, and adjusts the screen
warp code to use those macros as it was done in q1, so it would
not crash in water so long as your resolution is a legitimate
one: you should take care to filter your resolutions accordingly.


Additional note about horplus fov and softrender:  the changes
need implementing in r_misc.c:R_ViewChanged() and R_SetupFrame(),
and ref_soft needs notifying about horplus being in effect or
not.  See the changes in q2dos port I did for this; the relevant
commits should be these four:

I've tested a little bit and so far nearly everything seems to work. UI scaling, the overbright bit are looking very good, extremly high resolutions are running fine and even the annoying problem with water surfaces doesn't occure. :)
Just two small bugs:

If the videos are played in an widescreen window they're are placed in the middle and the surround background should be black. With the softrenderer that background is magenta. That's likely an ""set everything to black"" missing somewhere.
The brightness slider in the video menu is inversed.

There may be a problem with the vsync. The game holds 60hz just  perfectly but there seems to be some micro stuttering, like some frame are delayed for too long. But that may be an Xorg or driver problem on my side. I'll check that in the next few days and report back.
Otherwise I'm fine with merging that. One remaining question is what to do with the cvars. I have an idea how we could rewrite the cvars at config loading time. With such mechanism we could rename gl_* back to r_*. I'll to discuss that with @DanielGibson.
And you may add yourself to the credits in menu.c right below ""Sander van Dijk"". :)",True,{}

I just tried to implement CMake support for the soft renderer and stumbled over a somewhat scary problem. There're some symbol collissions between the client and the new ref_soft.so: At least some of the symbols in vid.c (starting with line 438) are  defined in both the client and the ref_soft.so library, which symbol takes precendence is dependend on the linker flags. If the symbols in the client have higher precedence, the ref_soft.so calls back into the client as soon as one of these symbols is referenced for the first time. The function in the client tries to call the one in the ref_soft.so, but instead it calls itself. This results in an endless recursion until the stack overflows... So, can you rename the colliding symbols in ref_soft.so?

We need to derive the millisecond counter from the microsecond counter, otherwise they diverge and the player sees subtile timing problems. And at my tests SDL_GetTicks() wasn't precise enough. I didn't look at the code back than but it seemed like SDL caches the value for some time and doesn't redetermine it at every call.
One well ment tip: Do yourself a favour and leave everything timing related alone. Quake IIs timing code is a bitch (sorry), even small changes can break it in very subtile and hard to notice ways.

Right now, we (mostly?) only use at at the ""edges"" to the system (window handing, sound, ...), very few source files make any SDL calls - even the OpenGL backends only have one source file with SDL stuff each.
For the SW renderer this is different, and that's OK because SDL is its graphics API, but let's keep the generic code generic.

I would expect the particle to scale with the resolution (like it does in the GL renderers)
d_pix_shift = 8 - (int)((float)r_refdef.vrect.width / 320.0 + 0.5); means that at 320x240, d_pix_shift will be 7.
So at 640x480 it should be 6 and at 1280x960 it should be 5.
The following code should yield that behavior and seems to work.
It's a matter of taste whether we should round up (+0.5 in last line) or not; it makes particles in resolutions between320 and 640 or 640 and 1280 look a bit bigger than they should.
	float widthFac = (float)r_refdef.vrect.width / 320.0;
	float logFac = log2(widthFac); // 0 for width == 320, 1 for 640, 2 for 1280
	// I round the factor up with +0.5, so particles might be a bit too big (instead of a bit too small)
	// for resolutions between i*320 and (i+1)*320, like 800x600
	d_pix_shift = 7 - (int)(logFac + 0.5);
On the other hand, I'm not sure d_pix_shift is such a great idea at all, it's used like
pix = izi >> d_pix_shift;
Maybe it would be better to do a multiplication instead of a shift and use a corresponding factor?
like float d_pix_factor =  (float)r_refdef.vrect.width / 320.0f and then pix = (izi >> 7) * d_pix_factor;?
That way the particle sizes should scale better with resolutions (I haven't tested it though)",True,{}

Two things however:

I think the particles could be a bit bigger - IMO, pix = (izi * d_pix_mul) >> 7; looks better than shifting by 8. But this is mostly a matter of taste I guess?
I personally like the new particle shape better - but I prefer the OpenGL renderer with filtered textures anyway. I guess the people who prefer a softrenderer also prefer the oldschool square particles. I guess if you add rounder particles, that should be configurable via cvar?",True,{}

But I see the same problems as you on the laptop with Linux and Intel.
One problem is that SWimp_Shutdown() calls SDL_Quit*(). That's clearly wrong, SDL is now initialized and deinitialized by vid.c. The problem with the duplicate window is somewhat more tricky. I've missed a call to ShutdownGraphics() in GLimp_Shutdown() but that's not enough. We need  to destroy the window at renderer shutdown by calling ShutdownGraphics() from VID_ShutdownRenderer(). With that the window handling works but the softrenderer doesn't show anything. So we likely need to reset SDLs internal GL state when the GL renderers are shutting down. And tada it work.
The code (more or less untested!) can be found here: https://github.com/yquake2/yquake2/tree/renderswitch This is of course still hacky. In theory we would need a swimp_sdl.c at client side and vid.c needs to track if GL or soft renderer is running. But that's a lot of work. Maybe for cold winter evenings. :)
Renaming both sw_texture_filtering and gl_anisotropic to r_anisotropic is a good idea. You need to add them to the replacement list in cvar.c, otherwise older config will break.",True,{}

In the old SDL 1.2 world there was no real distinction between the window and the GL state. When SDL 2.0 arrived we hacked the code to support the old SDL 1.2 way and the newly introduced window <-> state seperation. In the last weeks I've removed SDL 1.2 support, put the window handling in the client and the GL state handling in the renderer. Having the state handled by the renderer saves a lot calls between client and renderer. Additionally I've cleaned up some historical dept like the SDL reinitialization at vid_restart.
This is somewhat complicated by the missuse of vid_fullscreen. The client and all renderers set the vid_fullscreen cvar to 'modified' to communicate changes to the renderer configuration, triggering a vid_restart.

On the one hand it would be nice if macOS users could build YQ2 as easily as possible, but the problem with Xcode project files is that neither Yamagi nor me have a Mac, and thus we can't adjust those projects when needed (if we add or rename a file that needs to be compiled etc).
With CMake we don't have those problems, we can adapt CMakelists.txt accordingly and make sure it still builds at least on Linux/BSD/Windows, so if we have a working CMake setup for Mac once it's unlikely to break in a major way.
By the way, we recently moved some files around (see current master) when removing SDL1.2 and doing related cleanups; we also removed dependencies on zlib and libogg and libvorbis(file) by using miniz and stb_vorbis.h - this should make building on Mac even easier. I think the only dependencies apart from the standard C and system headers (incl. OpenGL) are SDL2 and OpenAL now.",True,{}

I just had a look. Just 2 nits:

Please, please, please no unnecessary changes to shared.(c|h). Both files should only be changed if really necessary since they're shared between all addons and mods. Changes to them have a high probability to break things. And even if they don't debugging the server <-> game API get's more complicated with every alteration.
Can we rename r_anisotropic back to gl_ansitropic and sw_texturefilter or something the like? I know, I approved the change. But after some pondering and discussion with @DanielGibson I relly think it's better to have 2 distinct cvars for it.

When trying to join a server from the client this error is shown twice. No other errors are displayed as far as I can see.
Changing the address to '::/128' also works and looking at the table you posted appears to be the correct address. I'll update the PR.
This is really strange. I'm assuming (but have not tested) using address '::' works just fine on Windows and Linux?
Just to be complete. This is the terminal output when starting a dedicated server with the address set to '::'.

There's no need to distinguish between FreeBSD and other non Linux platforms.
The third case, new_size == old_size is missing. I guess we never hit that by pure luck. Since n is never reset to something else than 0 the n != membase check down below triggers and the client is quit.

But the cppcheck stuf... I don't know. Okay, most if not all changes look correct. On the other hand they introduce unnecessary churn.

@Yamagi What do you think about 9fa0f12 ? It will restore all original API and functions. And create itemlist with MAX_ITEMS items so iteration by itemlist will be safe. Other changes should be without side effects(only move iteration variables to loop's).
About  sw_retexturing - can make game unusable because it will change contrast of textures (only 4 bits for brights value) and apply only to nonskin textures. So i prefer to save it disabled for several iteration.",True,{}

It may be possible to use a native clang instead, but I never had the patients to figure that out.
Regarding cmake and SDL2: I really don't know. The CMakeLists.txt works on FreeBSD, Linux and MacOS, so it should also work on Windows. But I've never tried it and I have no clue what the SDL2 module does to find the library.

I like that idea, I think the Id team for sure would have made it like that if there were people playing with controllers back in those days. It would be cool to be able to say  'bind K_HAT_UP + K_JOY6 ""use Grenade Launcher""'. It probably is a bit more work though cause I guess the parser would need to be able to understand it and some generalized form of it supported in cl_keyboard.c
I might try and have a look at it, but I think this solution is still probably a good leg-up for most players out there using example the retropie/retroarch + controller and a dual-stick controller like the ps4 controller or xbox controller. It is pretty standard in FPS-like game to choose weapon using these keys on a controller at least on the PS4.
Trying to dive into your doom3 port as well, would be awesome to bring that to the say the retropie. But might prove to be a bit to big of a challenge since Im guessing it will need a opengl es 2.0 port and Im just one guy already pushing 40h at my pay-for-the-food-and-rent job :)",True,{}

I've re-worked the solution a bit more. I chosed to go with a cvar solution to be able to map the alternative keys and add an additional menu ""customize controls alt function"" (maybe the name should change - anyone got a better one?) where you can map the extra keys. The reason I choose to store it cvars is simply because it seemed like to much of a mess to try and hitch on to the bind logic.
The menu sends a ""bind KEY ""do this thing"" using Com_sprintf in Keys_MenuKey. The ""bind"" command in turn is tied to char *keybindings (cl_keyboard.c). So to support using bind, I would need to either expand the keybindings entry and re-write all functions that look into that (which is quite
intricate if one just freetext search keybindings and see all the code that peeks and pokes at this data).
I just think it introduces to much of a risk for bugs/unexpected behaviour to grant updating the ""bind"" code. If not updating the ""bind"" code I would need to introduce a new command and use that especially for this thing, which did not feel right either. Hence, I choose to use cvars and use the same infrastructure that the menu uses for binding keys (Com_sprintf, but sending a ""set weaponblahblah_key_X ""SOME KEY"") and then I use the same cvars in cl_keyboard.c to figure out what button combination equals what action. This way, it can also be set in .cfg file on startup directly.
Any thoughts on this one? I want to clean it up a bit. Perhaps change name from weaponselector to ""alternate"" or something like that and try to add support for 3 more things I think might be nice to reach using the ""alternate"" key - inventory (previous, next, use).
I've already checked in this change so you can have a look at it and see if you think this is a sufficent solution though. And weigh in on the added menu, if you like that idea or not.
I did this all under a bit of a fever and headache but I just could'nt keep away - let me know if something looks weird or is just not proper.

Hope your having a nice weekend.
Tried the ""Allow second layer of keybindings for controllers"" fix today on the retropie, unfortunately it does'nt build. I fetched it from https://github.com/DanielGibson/yquake2.git. It seems like the render libraries are not built when using this one. It builds and runs fine from the original stream (https://github.com/yquake2/yquake2.git) and also from my pull-request stream
(https://github.com/blargelJim/yquake2.git), perhaps you forked of when there was some change made that causes this?
I've looked through your changes and I cant really see anything in it that could cause this issue.
Did you make any other changes to it that is not visible on the pull-request change (would guess that is not possible but not an expert on github)?
I've put the build-log up at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tBMNrT0tLhTTPsQZ6mp8LbUvnhOaBU8I though it seems to be cut off at the end where the actual error pops up, which is basically saying that the ref1_gl.so could'nt be copied because it was just never built at all (I could see this in the build folder on the retropie).
I took a picture of the error from the retropie at the end of the log where this installation error message shows up to and put it at
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9mTOmE2d6oZQmFQaklhcURLS2hOOXEwdVR1WTlfYWZvUFhv
Any chance you could rebase the pull-request repo so you get the changes from the ""main stream""? Ought to work.

Just got home and tested it from the main repo and it works beautifully :)
Me personally I'm happy with this fix. A menu option would of course be a nice-to-have but it might be a bit more work, especially if we want to support mods with other weapon names in it.
As for the common retropie user, I think most will be happy if there is a mapping for the most common controllers (ps4 + xbox controller) and an wiki-entry informing about this.
For the PS4 which I have tested it on this setting works pretty well:
(I'm trying to reach out to the retropie repo owners to push an update for this)
bind JOY6 ""+joyaltselector""
bind HAT_LEFT ""use Shotgun""
bind HAT_UP ""use Super Shotgun""
bind HAT_RIGHT ""use Machinegun""
bind HAT_DOWN ""use Chaingun""
bind HAT_LEFT_ALT ""use Grenade Launcher""
bind HAT_UP_ALT ""use Rocket Launcher""
bind HAT_RIGHT_ALT ""use HyperBlaster""
bind HAT_DOWN_ALT ""use Railgun""
If everyone is ok with this fix I guess I can remove my pull-request?

it's nice to wake up and find something like this in the mailbox. Of course I haven't had a chance to take a deeper look, I just played through base1. First let me make clear, that I'm not against merging this. But before we can consider that some things needs to be ensured:

You've already linked to #373. @DanielGibson already wrote there, that neither he nor me have any knowledge about Vulkan. While it would be a nice project to read into it, hack a little bit around, etc. we currently don't have the time to do that. We aren't students anymore, we've got daytime jobs, families and other projects. Therefore it's inevitable that someone with Vulkan knowledge is willing to maintain this renderer. Work through bug report, analyse and fix the bugs, chase changes in GPU driver and the Vulkan SDK if necessary... More or less the same as we did for the software renderer.
There're likely some things that needs to be ruled out before we can merge it. It needs documentation, compiling the code with gcc9 gave some warnings, the gamma scale is the wrong way round (in the OpenGL renderers higher values are brighter, with the Vulkan renderer higher values are darker), typing disconnect into the console freezes the renderer... That are all fixable problems, but they need to be solved.

On a bigger scale the big question is if Vulkan is really the way to go or if it would be better to use something like https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx. With that we would get Vulkan, DirectX, Metal and WebGL by doing all the work involved with adding and maintaining a renderer only once.",True,{}

Fix the gamma (likely something like vid_gamma->value * -1 missing somewhere), fix the renderer hanging after disconnect (start a game with map base1, disconnect from it with disconnect and the renderer freezes) and update this pull request with the changes.
We merge the renderer into a feature branch and provide official test build. The test builds will be linked on the homepage. Fix upcoming bugs (I don't think that there will be many since the major part code was already tested in vkQ2), enhance the renderer API as needed (there aren't any out of tree consumers anyways) and write documentation.

thank you for your continued efforts. Let's start with some general comments:

Reviewing is much easier if the pull request / review request has only the relevant commits and not unrelated stuff. It would be really helpfull if rebasing / merging commits from master into the feature branch and actual changes can be kept separate.
From my experience it is a good idea to avoid unnecessary changes to the upstream code, it just makes merging future changes harder.
Does the Vulkan renderer really need the texture resizing stuff? Can't the textures just uploaded as they are? If I remember right the resizing code was only to support very early GPUs that required power of two textures. And is the STB resize code suited for Quake IIs low res textured, doesn't it change the look on such old GPUs if the textures are resized with a better algorithm? Doesn't a better algorithm require more CPU power?

Regarding the menu pop-ups: It's working now, but is it really a good idea to enter the renderer and abort the frame by returning early? Who not just adding a new function to the render API. There aren't any 3rd party renderers anyways, as far as I know.",True,{}

If people are feeling clever, they're going to break it anyway. This setup matches how the compiler flags are normally handled in Autotools (always), Meson (always), and CMake (with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=none).
The typical use of this in distributions is for packaging infrastructure (dpkg-buildflags or RPM macros) to build everything with debug symbols (-g), a conservative optimization level (-O2 or -O0 depending whether an unoptimized build was requested), and add security-hardening options like stack-protector and PIE.
Would it help if I wrapped it like this?
ifeq ($(WITH_COMPILER_FLAGS), yes)
# Take compiler flags from the environment. If you enable this, any broken
# builds that result are entirely your responsibility.
YQ2_CFLAGS += $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS)
(etc.)

Great!

and WITH_SYSTEMWIDE cannot be set to yes

Is there a reason why not? WITH_SYSTEMWIDE but no RPATH is the configuration we use in Debian, and if the Debian package doesn't count as a system-wide installation, I don't know what is.
We put the quake2 and q2ded executables in /usr/lib/yamagi-quake2, the native-code (architecture-dependent) game modules in /usr/lib/yamagi-quake2/baseq2/game.so and so on, and the architecture-independent assets (pak files, videos, music) in /usr/share/games/quake2. I think that's in line with what you recommend in 070_packaging.md?
Unless I'm missing some secondary function, the RPATH is only needed if you are linking the game executable to shared libraries (SDL, libcurl etc.) in a non-standard location, for example bundled with yquake2. That's likely to be something you'd want to do if you are shipping a generic Linux binary designed to be portable between distributions, but the Debian package only needs to run on Debian, and gets all its shared libraries from the default library search path.
If I understand correctly, game.so is searched in the game search path (which includes the directory the executable is in) and passed to dlopen as an absolute path, and the refresher/renderer modules like ref_gl3.so are searched in the executable's directory and passed to dlopen as an absolute path, so it's unnecessary for the directory that contains them to appear in the RPATH (unless it also contains bundled libraries, which, again, distro packages don't).",True,{}

One way to deal with this would be to use -std=gnu99 (which is C99 with GNU extensions), or to not use a -std option at all (because the default in any vaguely recent gcc version is gnu99 or newer). This is the approach I'd be inclined to use.
Another would be to get the readlink declaration by using feature test macros (Linux readlink(2) says defining _XOPEN_SOURCE to a value >= 500, or _POSIX_C_SOURCE to a value >= 200112L, should work; or you could define _GNU_SOURCE which enables all the extensions), and to use __asm__ for inline assembly.

And added INCLUDE to the list of overideable variables.

It does seem weird to be telling the compiler in the Makefile ""please implement C99"", and then ask it in src/common/header/shared.h whether it's implementing C11...

Not really. :) We're building in C99 mode, because we want stay compatible with older compilers. And maybe one day we'll port the code MSVC, every feature from newer C standards will make that harder... On the other hand we're adding C11 pathes for everything that isn't covered in older standards, it'll make ports to other C11 compliant compilers with no or only a few GNU extensions easier",True,{}

build: Add an option to turn off RPATHs
When distributions like Debian build binaries that are going to use the
standard system-wide libraries in directories that are searched by
default, it's undesired to have a RPATH that makes the library search
behaviour less predictable. Continue to set the RPATH by default, for
use in portable binaries, but provide an off-switch.

Just removing -std doesn't seem to work with my compiler (gcc 9.2.1): it defaults to C11 mode, but in C11 mode, in src/common/header/shared.h, because STDC_VERSION is defined to 201112L or later, we define YQ2_ATTR_NORETURN as _Noreturn. Unfortunately, gcc doesn't seem to interpret _Noreturn as being valid to attach to function pointers (unlike its attribute((noreturn)) extension), but there are a couple of function pointers tagged with YQ2_ATTR_NORETURN, causing the build to fail in C11 mode.

I have a patch to separate YQ2_ATTR_NORETURN into YQ2_ATTR_NORETURN and YQ2_ATTR_NORETURN_FUNCPTR (with the latter only having an effect on gcc/clang, like the GLib change proposed on https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/merge_requests/1078) which I'll turn into a MR when I've rebased it onto your latest cflags work.",True,{}

On what GPUs and platforms was this tested? Does it pass validation cleanly?

Code have tested on RADV and SwiftShader with enabled _DEBUG and VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation.

Also the spec-required minimum for ""maximum memory allocations"" can be as low as 4096. Are you sure you're never allocating more images and buffers than that?

Yes, quake has own limitation of amount objects(images/buffers) and it never more than we had on end of 90s.

Is not having to compile one file as C++ worth all that?

We have used very limited subset of vulkan functionality and usage only one language in whole code base is worth it. vk_utils is ported from q2vkpt and q2rtx, if we have issues with code in future, we always can backport solution from nvidia rtx version.",True,{}

I had a discussion about this with some people that know a lot more than me about ARM. The general consent is:

For 32-Bit ARM it should be okay to force -march=armv6k. It would cover everything starting from the first RPi generation and older cores are too slow for YQ2 anyway.
For 64-Bit ARM we could force -march=armv8.0-a, it would cover all aarch64 compatible cores.

Building with a -march= argument attempts to override the compiler's
configuration. In distributions that target a higher baseline CPU
than we specify, -march=armv6k will force the compiler to try to build
for ARMv6K specifically, rather than that higher baseline.
For example, in Debian's ""armhf"" port (like many 32-bit ARM ports), the
compiler targets ARMv7 with the VFPv3D16 floating-point extensions, and
the port explicitly does not support older CPUs. Asking it to build for
armv6k just fails, which appears to be because armv6k implies an older
VFP (floating point) ABI than anything this compiler supports. Even if
it succeeded, it would produce binaries that unnecessarily do not take
full advantage of the distribution's ARMv7 baseline.
Conversely, in distributions that target a lower baseline CPU than
we specify, building with an explicit -march= option will produce an
executable that cannot run successfully on the distribution's baseline
CPU. For example, Debian's ""armel"" port (ARMv5TE) and the baseline used in
Raspbian (ARMv6, with no K) are designed to be compatible with older ARM
CPUs, even if the CPU they are actually run on in practice might be newer,
such as the ARMv7 in the Raspberry Pi version 2. Individual packages in
these distributions are not generally allowed to override that baseline.
Instead, let the distribution or user set their target CPU (distributions
configure their gcc to default to a specified baseline, while users can
put -march=native or another suitable -march= option in their CFLAGS if
they want a binary suitable for their specific system), and conditionally
enable the yield instruction at compile-time if that target CPU has
it. As far as I can find out, yield was added in ARMv6K, a minor revision
of ARMv6, so it should be available in all ARMv7 or higher CPUs (which
includes anything 64-bit), plus ARMv6 CPUs if they are actually ARMv6K.
Using -march=armv8-a on 64-bit ARM (aarch64) was unnecessary in any
case, because it is the oldest form of aarch64: the only effect of that
option would be to disable newer functionality if the compiler defaults
to enabling it (which I suspect no distributions do yet, but they might
consider in a few years' time).

I believe this is correct, but it might be too conservative: adding || defined(__ARM_ARCH_6KZ__) to the condition might also work (I'm unsure whether ARMv6KZ is strictly a superset of ARMv6K).
This has been successfully compiled (although not tested at runtime) on Debian armhf and armel, with some #warning to tell me which code path it's taking. It appears to enable the yield instruction on armhf (ARMv7) but not on armel (ARMv5), which is what should happen here.

compiler targets ARMv7 with the VFPv3D16 floating-point extensions, and
the port explicitly does not support older CPUs. Asking it to build for
armv6k just fails, which appears to be because armv6k implies an older
VFP (floating point) ABI than anything this compiler supports. Even if
it succeeded, it would produce binaries that unnecessarily do not take
full advantage of the distribution's ARMv7 baseline.
Conversely, in distributions that target a lower baseline CPU than
we specify, building with an explicit -march= option will produce an
executable that cannot run successfully on the distribution's baseline
CPU. For example, Debian's ""armel"" port (ARMv5TE) and the baseline used in
Raspbian (ARMv6, with no K) are designed to be compatible with older ARM
CPUs, even if the CPU they are actually run on in practice might be newer,
such as the ARMv7 in the Raspberry Pi version 2. Individual packages in
these distributions are not generally allowed to override that baseline.
Instead, let the distribution or user set their target CPU (distributions
configure their gcc to default to a specified baseline, while users can
put -march=native or another suitable -march= option in their CFLAGS if
they want a binary suitable for their specific system), and conditionally
enable the yield instruction at compile-time if that target CPU has
it. As far as I can find out, yield was added in ARMv6K, a minor revision
of ARMv6, so it should be available in all ARMv7 or higher CPUs (which
includes anything 64-bit), plus ARMv6 CPUs if they are actually ARMv6K.
Using -march=armv8-a on 64-bit ARM (aarch64) was unnecessary in any
case, because it is the oldest form of aarch64: the only effect of that
option would be to disable newer functionality if the compiler defaults
to enabling it (which I suspect no distributions do yet, but they might
consider in a few years' time).

I believe this is correct, but it might be too conservative: adding || defined(__ARM_ARCH_6KZ__) to the condition might also work (I'm unsure whether ARMv6KZ is strictly a superset of ARMv6K).
This has been successfully compiled (although not tested at runtime) on Debian armhf and armel, with some #warning to tell me which code path it's taking. It appears to enable the yield instruction on armhf (ARMv7) but not on armel (ARMv5), which is what should happen here.

arm: Only use yield instruction if supported
The default on 32-bit ARM is now -march=armv6k, but it's overridable,
and must be overridden on some toolchains that have a higher baseline
and cannot compile for -march=armv6k. This includes Debian armhf
(ARMv7 with the VFPv3D16 floating-point extensions), where armv6k
appears to imply an older VFP (floating point) ABI than anything the
compiler supports.
Conditionally enable the yield instruction at compile-time if the target
CPU has it. As far as I can find out, yield was added in ARMv6K, a minor
revision of ARMv6, so it should be available in all ARMv7 or higher CPUs
(which includes anything 64-bit), plus ARMv6 CPUs if they are actually
ARMv6K.


Don't force target CPU to armv8-a on aarch64
ARMv8-A is the oldest/most-limited/least-extended version of aarch64,
analogous to the earliest AMD 64-bit processor in the x86 world.
As a result, forcing this target CPU can only disable features, and
isn't going to enable anything we might want. The yield opcode was
added in ARMv7, and all aarch64 CPUs are ARMv8-A or higher (which is
a superset of ARMv7), so no special architecture specification is
necessary to access the yield opcode.



I've marked this as WIP because of the following issues:


The first commit message says it's overridable, but having that actually work requires merging the cflags branch first.


As noted above, if you want the default on 32-bit ARM to be representative of CPUs people actually have, I suspect better options are either trust the compiler vendor to have done the right thing (as in the original version of this branch), or go for ARMv7 (which will work on Raspberry Pi v2 or later but not on the Raspberry Pi v1 or Raspberry Pi Zero, the same as Debian armhf and Fedora ARMv7).",True,{'THUMBS_UP': ['https://github.com/devnexen']}

cc @devnexen, @0lvin","I've just merged the cflags branch. Now there's a conflict in the Makefile, because I moved the -march= stuff further up and added a longer comment explaining the rationale behind it and what to do if someone really wants to build for ARM5 or older ARM6 CPUs. Can you resolve it? After that i'll merge this PR and hopefully everybody is happy. :)
Regarding the minimum architecture: Everything up to and including the RPi 3B+ is too slow for playing Quake II. That's mostly caused by the crappy GPU driver and it's dead slow legacy OpenGL implementation. I'm getting about 37 FPS at 640x480... For more performance we would need an OpenGL ES 2.0 renderer. I don't think that we'll ever write one, it's too much work for an already  outdated niche platform. The RPi 4 has an OpenGL ES 3.0 compatible GPU, adding an ES 3.0 path to the GL3 renderer is rather easy. We had an experiment implementation somewhere during the GL3 development, it was abandoned due to the lack of hardware. We'll likely revive it some day.
So going to ARMv7 as the default minimum shouldn't be a big problem. We could just go for -march=armv7 and see if anyone complains.",True,{}

come from paks will listed in their order of appearence in their pak.
Files that are stored in the maps/ folder will be appear in a
alphabetically sorted manner.

In the screenshot provided with my pull request. Maps listed from
'mine1' to 'boss2' are maps from the baseq2 pak files. 'angron1a' and
'angron1b' are custom maps which are present in the 'maps/' subdirectory
in baseq2.

I feel this is fine because users of this command will probably be
interested in listing the map names from their maps/ folder to know
which custom map to load. If there's a better idea on the overall
sorting though, I'd be glad to give it a go on the implementation side.

that's a nice idea. And good work! The code looks clean and easy understandable But, I hate to say this: Welcome to the wonderful world of the Quake II virtual file system. ;) The file system is buggy, most bugs cannot be fixed (because mods may rely on them) and them and we fiddled things like more dynamic search paths into it while staying bug to bug compatible... There's something(tm) wrong with your mod detection code or even the path finding magic. When the binarydir is the same as the basedir (the binaries are copied into the basedir), everything works like it should:

Allows setting mouse sensitivity to 0 in UI to work around a RetroPie bug where controller input was showing up as both joystick and mouse events

Yes, changes contain only remove mono/stereo check. All other changes are related only to the code style or remove unused code.
About SDL/OpenAl behaiviour:

SDL audio works without any issues or changes from our side for mod. Maybe it has some issues that I have not caught.
OpenAL has differences in sound behavior, when defender soldier took attention - sound is too loud and long if compare to original sound.

I have resolved OpenAl by replace to stereo files based on origin:
ffmpeg -i SOLSGHT1.wav -af ""pan=stereo|c0=c0|c1=c0"" sound/soldier/solsght1.wav
ffmpeg -i SOLSGHT1.wav -af ""pan=stereo|c0=c0|c1=c0"" sound/soldier/solsrch1.wav
SOLSGHT1.wav: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 16 bit, mono 22050 Hz
sound/soldier/solsght1.wav: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 16 bit, stereo 22050 Hz

As i expect that it related to sound volume <-> distance function to source.
If we speak about regressions with original mono sound - code works without any issues as I see. And we can advertise this functionality as initial implementation that required changes in mods or at least checking ;-)",True,{}

Given the Vulkan backend uses 3 render passes with a single subpass each, specifying barriers using subpass dependencies felt weird to me, so I've replaced them with proper memory barriers between render passes. I believe they're easier to understand and reason about.","So I've changed the branch a bit restoring and tuning the previous external subpass dependencies and keeping the convenient Qvk_MemoryBarrier function. I've studied the spec in more detail and I could even write a blog post explaining my reasoning for the changes, because Vulkan synchronization is not easy to explain in a few words. The summary would be:
First, as I mentioned above, external subpass dependencies are used to control layout transitions from the initial layout of the attachment in the render pass to the layout in the first subpass that uses the attachment, and from the last layout to the final layout specified in the render pass. In our case, these layout transitions happen and must be controlled so images are not transitioned before all operations have completed on them, creating a race. Most of my initial changes have been reverted because the memory barriers I introduced, while correct from the point of view of stages and data dependencies, do not allow us to control these layout transitions.
Second, the first external subpass dependency has been modified. After the skybox fixes we now want to load the color buffer contents from the previous frame before drawing on it again, and this was not correctly taken into account. For the first subpass dependency (used from previous render passes to rendering the world), we need to transition the color attachment before color attachment read operations (i.e. the attachment load) are performed, so I've added that access to the dependency.
Third an finally, a remark on global memory barriers and the question of them being a heavy hammer: I've seen several people, most notably Axel Gneiting from id Software who worked on the renderers for the new Doom games, mention in the Khronos Slack that they use memory barriers for synchronization as the general mechanism, and only fall back to image memory barriers when they want to also perform an image layout transition. While a global memory barrier does look like a heavy hammer, they're much easier to use and apparently it's standard industry practice, so I wouldn't worry too much about it if you want to use them somewhere else.

Intel under Linux.
Nvidia under Windows.
Nvidia behind Optimus under Linux.
Radeon with ACO under Linux.

@DanielGibson, can you gave it a try with your Radeon under Windows and maybe Intel on Windows? We want to know if there any performance regressions between this branch and master. I don't think so, but better be save than sorry.

I believe they're easier to understand and reason about.","@rg3 After merge looks like we have new warning message with vk_validation=2, could you please check?
VK_WARNING: Validation Performance Warning: [ UNASSIGNED-BestPractices-vkCreateRenderPass-image-requires-memory ] Object 0: handle = 0x62800001c100, type = VK_OBJECT_TYPE_DEVICE; | MessageID = 0x4003982 | Attachment 2 in the VkRenderPass is a multisampled image with 4 samples, but it uses loadOp/storeOp which requires accessing data from memory. Multisampled images should always be loadOp = CLEAR or DONT_CARE, storeOp = DONT_CARE. This allows the implementation to use lazily allocated memory effectively. (performance)


That's a consequence of the skybox fixes. To hide geometry errors in levels and the way the skybox coordinates are calculated, creating geometry that's not watertight, I made the game load the contents of the previous frame before drawing the next one on it, visually masking many errors in the same way the OpenGL renderer does. These changes mean the color attachment (single sample or multisample) has to be loaded when the render pass starts and always stored after drawing, hence the warning. Nothing to worry about, IMHO.",True,{}

It's my understanding, from reading other parts of the code, that such an approach is a bit hackish and there should be a message sent from the client  to the server to properly communicate this, but my knowledge of the code base is lacking here, so I preferred to get the fix out and let others with more experience tune it as needed.","And finally merged, thank you!",True,{}

First, I've tweaked the code so changing the anisotropic filter value from the video menu does not apply the change immediately. Instead, now you must hit ""Apply"" and let the renderer restart. The problem this tries to solve is that, in Vulkan, the anisotropic and texture filter modes are part of the texture sampler object. If you want to support any combination of these parameters independently, you only have two options:


You create a huge number of texture samplers with every combination of texture and anisotropic filter values, and select the one to apply on the fly based on user settings. This is what's used now, but to cut down on the number of combinations the anisotropic filter value in Vulkan is now an on/off switch, and the maximum anisotropy is applied if not off. I wanted to change that.


The second approach is to carefully rebuild texture samplers on the fly when the user requests a change in texture sampling parameters, but this has to be done very carefully. In theory, you must not delete a texture sampler that's already recorded in a command buffer before the command buffer finishes executing and is destroyed. This is not too hard, but the current state of the code doesn't make this easy.


Because video options are changed seldomly, I don't think it's a problem to restart the renderer when the anisotropic filter value is changed. When the renderer starts, texture samplers are created with the appropriate anisotropy value chosen by the user, so it's not longer an on/off switch and we also cut the number of texture samplers almost in half.","My original goal with these changes was just fixing #662, but I've fixed a couple of additional issues.

I hadn't the time to reply to the e-mails. So let's continue here: I can't set self->die in the default case, because it would change the behavior of the commander_body entity.

Player does pain sound in lava with godmode on

A small oversight by id. They check for the invul powerup but not the godmode flag. I just added the godmode flag check.

Player gib sound is rarely replaced by a footstep

This is a side-effect of change to sound priority ordering. Footstep events schedule the sound after the server frame has ends so it would override the gib sound. This was fixed by adding a check for player's health, and also by changing the channel the gib sound is played on (see later).

Player gib sound is played on the wrong channel

This is a bug in the original game and causes player death scream and gib sound to play over each other if the player is killed by a powerful shotgun blast or is gibbed very quickly after dying. It was playing on the CHAN_BODY channel but should have been CHAN_VOICE. This change is also consistent with monsters, which play their gibs on CHAN_VOICE.

Incorrect death sound plays some times

Another side-effect of the change to sound priority is that pain sound could override the death sound. This would happen if for example a shotgun blast first hurts the player and then kills him, all in a single server frame. Was easily fixed by adding a check for player health for the pain sound code.
I also prevented the death scream from overriding the gib sound which could happen after  I made both play on the same channel. Fixed by using the sounds variable to aggregate the sound effect, and then play it at the end of the server frame in P_DamageFeedback.","This PR fixes some bugs with player sounds.

I have changed it to any sound in misc/menu/*, weapons/*, player{s}/*/pain/*, player/step/*, player/land/*. As result mostly any weapons has haptic feedback with volume and duration similar to sound effect.
And need to check haptic feedback with different gamepad(i have noname device), is result intuitive and comfortable for user? Or too long/short/loud/insync to effects?

How can I reproduce the model preview icon bug you fixed?

It also greatly optimizes and shortens the code by skipping all the unnecessary string copying.,"Yamagi and me discussed this a bit, and there's still this issue I mentioned in #757:

Are there legit usecases for - or at least + within an argv string? Like yquake2.exe +set game rogue+map whatever (without a space before +map that would turn rogue and +map into separate argvs)?

And while ""legit"" of course is always debatable, we fear that there's indeed .bat scripts from old mods and things like that which have a command without a space before the +.
While my example (+set game rogue+map whatever) would never have worked, because Cbuf_AddEarlyCommands() clears all argvs of +set and its arguments, +map whatever+set r_fullscreen 0 would have worked before but not with this change.
So while the way you're doing it now is better code (and definitely is what id should have done in the first place - after all they basically do the same in Cbuf_AddEarlyCommands()), probably it would be better to keep the code like it was before (i.e. do that concatenation of the argvs) and only add special handling to the ""skip -"" case that makes sure to ignore - if the previous character is not a space",True,{}

Added a safety check to make sure the entity making the noise is actually a player
Made spawning of player_noise entities optional. If they fail to spawn, PlayerNoise() will not cause any sound event
Each time PlayerNoise() is called it will verify the mynoise variables of the player, and make an effort to repair them if needed
mynoise and mynoise2 can now be differentiated by spawnflags. self/weapon noises have none, while impact noises have spawnflag 1 set.

Do not add dependencies into the repository. Neither by importing the code, nor by submodules.
The build system must not download anything during build.
We don't want any editor or IDE specific stuff in the repo. A lesson we've learned a long time ago.
Contributed code (here miniz) must not be altered.

One big question remains: Why are all of these rather intruding changes in fragile and bug prone subsystems like the virtual filesystem are necessary? I understand that some users want better cmake support. But the ship for MSVC support has sailed years ago.

These days Yamagi Quake II is (more or less) in maintenance mode. Nearly all features, which could by added, while staying compatible with Vanilla Quake II and not changing the gameplay, have been added.

I've learned a lot from Yamagi Quake II, the project depicts my personal development from a university freshman to a IT professional. But life has moved on.  While we / I will continue to fix bugs, give user support and maybe implement some smaller new features, it's unlikely that Yamagi Quake II will ever see fast passed development or ground breaking new features again.
MSVC support by itself isn't a problem if done right. But, and that's a big but, it is another platform I / we need to support. It require test builds after code changes, there might be bug reports, etc. Exactly the points which prevented me from adding MSVC support even when I was spending whole weeksends hacking Yamagi Quake II. If it's just about debugger support, it might be better to look into refactoring the Makefile from hardcoded assumptions around mingw to something more generic which can use clang. clang can generate MSVC compatible debug symbols, I've used that for several other projects.

We already support kinda obscure platforms that we don't test ourselves, like Haiku or macOS.
As we're not planning to do major changes anymore, the risk of breaking a platform is relatively low, and if we do, the fix will (most probably) be small and easy as well.
So I think it's ok to not test all platforms regularly ourselves, and just fix things if/when someone reports it broken.

Note I'm not dunking on Haiku here, I think it's great to support non-mainstream systems :-)
Just pointing out that we already have code that neither Yamagi nor me test (or even just build) ourselves.

... and more bug prone.

Sure, but again, it's not that much code using VLAs so it's manageable.
OTOH, supporting another compiler (that doesn't try to emulate GCC) makes the code a bit more portable overall, and MSVC's diagnostics actually help finding bugs, especially ones related to Win32 APIs, see those WCHAR changes.
And it opens the door to use debugging or profiling tools that are VS-centric when it makes sense, which can be a nice addition to the stuff we get from the gcc/clang/Linux world.
And of course supporting VS makes it more likely to get contributions from developers using Windows who are used to it.
Side-rant: I have no idea how people are productive with VS, I find using it for development (and not just compiling and a bit of debugging) painful because everything that has to do with code navigation like ""find references"" or especially ""show call hierarchy"" is ridiculously slow, but most developers who primarily use Windows, like most game developers, use it.. maybe it gets more usable with commercial plugins like resharper or visual assist or sth, I don't know.

It still has it's nitpicks.

True, but both of those solutions require much bigger, more intrusive work. What I'm proposing here is much simpler, clear to understand and guaranteed to not produce any further errors. This is, at worst, a ""good enough"" patch until either of what you mention gets implemented.
Also, for now, a truly interested player can check out the new gamepad buttons' menus to see what it is bound to quad damage.
