Compilation
I can compile this PR on arch, but not under Ubuntu 16.04.
Under ubuntu I installed libspice-client-gtk-3.0-dev libspice-protocol-dev spice-protocol spice-client-gtk. CMake output says:
-- Finding suggested package SPICE.
--   Disable this using ""-DWITH_SPICE=OFF"".
-- Checking for module 'spice-protocol'
--   Found spice-protocol, version 0.12.10
-- Checking for module 'spice-client-gtk-3.0'
--   Found spice-client-gtk-3.0, version 0.30

But then, compilation fails with
fatal error: spice-client-gtk.h: No such file or directory
Any ideas to fix this and help me compile ? :)
SSH
Since the plugin does not support the integrated remmina ssh tunnel (remmina_plugin_service->protocol_plugin_start_direct_tunnel()), you are invited to use that function. Or, as a quick fix, remove the SSH configuration page by zeoring ""REMMINA_PROTOCOL_SSH_SETTING_TUNNEL"" the in remmina_plugin_spice struct.",True,{}

The refactoring is going in a very good direction, I like it very much - it makes things much easier. I have temporarily switched my openSUSE builds to your branch. It builds and runs without any problems.
Trying it out, I have found things which could still be improved.

Pressing  in the search bar tries to connect to the given address. IMHO most users have their connections stored in a list, so it would be very convenient when pressing  would automatically open the select (filtered) connection from the list.
The connection-type drop-down could be placed after the filter-field, which could be followed by a ""quick connect"" button to be used to connect to the given address using the given protocol (is there a combined select/submit button available in GTK?)
The ""+"" button could be moved left to the doughnut-menu-button and the filter/quick-connect related things to the very left of the menu bar.
The list-related commands (connect, copy, edit, delete) should be available via the drop-down menu only - I don't think they are really needed in the global menu. Also the ""new"" command could be removed from the menu - the new '+' button is very good and clear to understand.
From the list-item-context-menu I would completely remove the ""external tools"" as they are not related to the items at all. The sorting of the items should be ""connect"", ""---"", ""edit"", ""---"", ""copy"", ""delete"") to distinguish more between the types of commands.

Pressing Enter ? Interesting: I would really benefit for this. But using ENTER for quick connect is important too. It could be done as follow: when, after filtering, only one profile is shown on the filtered list, pressing ENTER on the textbox will connect to that profile ?

Here after my comments

Pressing  in the search bar tries to connect to the given address. IMHO most users have their connections stored in a list, so it would be very convenient when pressing  would automatically open the select (filtered) connection from the list.

The  behaviour is to replace the quick connect feature I've removed, but as you say, hitting  too early (that is quite instinctive) will try to open a connection with a non existing hosts.
As, while you type, the list is automatically refreshed, the  key is not needed at all.
What I can probably do, is to open the profile editor if the connection fails (?).
@giox069 comment:

when, after filtering, only one profile is shown on the filtered list, pressing ENTER on the textbox will connect to that profile ?

I'm thinking about it. It's not easy and fast for me.

The connection-type drop-down could be placed after the filter-field, which could be followed by a ""quick connect"" button to be used to connect to the given address using the given protocol (is there a combined select/submit button available in GTK?)

I didn't understand, sorry, would you mind doing a quick sketch (even on paper)?

The ""+"" button could be moved left to the doughnut-menu-button and the filter/quick-connect
related things to the very left of the menu bar.

I'll try

The list-related commands (connect, copy, edit, delete) should be available via the drop-down menu only - I don't think they are really needed in the global menu. Also the ""new"" command could be removed from the menu - the new '+' button is very good and clear to understand.

I agree

From the list-item-context-menu I would completely remove the ""external tools"" as they are not related to the items at all. The sorting of the items should be ""connect"", ""---"", ""edit"", ""---"", ""copy"", ""delete"") to distinguish more between the types of commands.

I may be agree but someone, don't remember who, told me that they use the ""external tools"" to test the connectivity before to use the profile.
In the future I was thinking to add a status column (I already implemented part of it)

But this is not easy when using ssh_tunnel and rdp/vnc gateway

So during my 2 hours session working for a customer, used profiles does not automatically move at the top of the sorted list.

This is already done, but at the moment you must move the focus in the quick connect bar.
I don't understand which signal I can use to do it in a better way.

But try to avoid to reparse all profile files when refreshing the list: the slow profile parsing problem is here again in remmina_main: for every key I type, search is very slow.

By default is already unhide, hiding the search bar is an option not the standard. So you can consider just the second screenshot.
Regarding the additional row I agree, but I don't have an easy and clean solution to stack it in the middle. We can just have it on the right (end) or on the left (start).
Moreover consider that I've removed completely the window decoration, so you lost one line but you got a new one, so you have lost zero at the end.
I'm undecided, I let you all decide because I really don't know.

I updated the commit by adding a respective checkbox to RDP settings UI. While doing that, I decided to change the setting item's name to ""disableautoreconnect"" and invert its meaning. I did so basically because of two reasons. First, it's more consistent with existing settings like ""disablepasswordstoring"" or ""disableclipboard"" which affect features that are meant to be turned on by default (as is autoreconnect). Second, I couldn't figure out how to set the default value of a setting checkbox to TRUE (if it's possible at all).
Please have a look.",True,{}

Remmina SPICE plugin does not support common spice-gtk options like --spice-ca-file or --spice-host-subject (one more thing to add to my TODO list...). Hence, when generating your self-signed certificate, CN and remote hostname must match. I.e: in your case, you have to replace myhostname.example.com by 10.10.10.247
Remmina SPICE plugin's Server CA Certificate field is equivalent to remote-viewer's --spice-ca-file option. Therefore, you should use ca-cert.pem. (Ignore this bullet point if it is the same file as server-ca.pem).

BTW, thanks for testing.",True,{}

Good job! :-) Thanks so much!
For me it can be merged.
Can you evaluate the following points? If it's easily possible to implemented one or all of them, we wait to merge, otherwise we can think about it afterwards.
The issues I've found.

I cannot copy some file type.
i.e. I cannot copy .core files, it's not something I need to copy... It's just something I've noted
I cannot get the progress bar, but I think it's because it's too fast.
If the file is not transferred there is no notifications.
It'd be nice to have notifications at the end of each transfers.
Are you able to put in place something like what I've done with the screenshots?

Here an example https://github.com/FreeRDP/Remmina/blob/next/remmina/src/remmina_connection_window.c#L1673
An other generic issue, it'd be nice to add a quick tip somewhere explaining that spice-vdagend must be running on the guest server (with the right user). Does spice provide I way to test is the vdaegnt is running?

I cannot copy some file type.
i.e. I cannot copy .core files, it's not something I need to copy... It's just something I've noted


I can't reproduce. I tried to transfer a bunch of files (including coredump) and it worked fine for me.


I cannot get the progress bar, but I think it's because it's too fast.


Did you try to drag and drop large files to see if the progress bar is displayed smoothly ?


If the file is not transferred there is no notifications.
It'd be nice to have notifications at the end of each transfers.
Are you able to put in place something like what I've done with the screenshots?


This can be easily added in the function remmina_plugin_spice_file_transfer_finished_cb() which is called at the end of each transfer. In my first attempts to implement this, I felt the notifications too annoying. I propose to merge this PR first and I will open another one so that we can experiment different designs more easily.

Nothing against with, and it's cool! Most of our users are on ubuntu, so we are already somehow oriented and that's why we have a PPA.
What I'm sceptic about, is to have distribution oriented files in the main repository as it may:

Make people we are strongly oriented
Invite other package maintainers  to add their files.

What will happens if also Fedora, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenSuSe, Archlinux, (sorry I cannot list all distros here) will ask to add their files in here?
The first issue is that we will have a number of ""distro"" folders in the Remmina root and the second one is that there will be a lot of job to do every time we will release a new version and also for the nightly builds.
I've probably missed the point, just let me know if I'm wrong.",True,{}

Good point, an example of what I had in mind:

there is a new Remmina release:
the official manteiner of distro X updates its fork
he/she updates files that need it
do the new package for distro X
he/she open a PR to us with the changes (that must be in the distro X scope)
we review the code and merge it

Thank you.

Issue one: remmina does not merge data dirs. If there are connections in higher priority dir of ${DG_DATA_HOME}:${XDG_DATA_DIRS}, or even just an empty dir exists, then connections from lower priority dirs are not shown.
I'm not sure is how it should work as per the freedesktop XDG spec.
All the software I use, for what I remember the use the first directory found starting form the higher priority.

Probably the best is to provide scripts to migrate and merge profiles and configuration files? This should fix also the second issue.

Issue two: remmina does not write config to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, always reads from $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS. [edit] it also does not save connections to $XDG_DATA_HOME.

If Remmina will try to write inside /etc or /usr/ it's normal because your user doesn't have the right to write there.

No, sorry but this by me it's wrong, or I get it wrong.
Reading the specification and man file-hierarchy, applications should not mix-up data and configuration files but read the one with the highest priority.
Now, and here I'm fighting with myself to find a good logic, if I open and modify a file that is inside XDG_DATA_DIRS (I don't even have a ${XDG_DATA_HOME} ), should I save it back to the XDG_DATA_DIRS or the ${XDG_DATA_HOME} one?
In my mind I should try to save it in the XDG_DATA_DIRS at first, and than, as a fallback if the remmina instance does not have writing rights in the ${XDG_DATA_DIRS} , save it in the ${XDG_DATA_HOME}. (same for the config)

If user has an override,  there is nothing to be done. The problem is that remmina creates this override by itself on launch. It should be created only when it is required (when user edits connection or config).

Just read directly from topmost priority file without copying anything.

So the only thing left to do is to make copying on-demand, rather than on start. This would probably require defaulting option ""remember last view for each connection"" to false and making ""save settings when starting connection"" to only write when something was actually changed in connection.
Low priority on this is perfectly fine by me, now that XDG basics work.
...some other minor thing: Deleting connection from the list. If connection file exists in system-level dirs, user can not actually remove it. There are two ways of dealing with this:

replace ""Delete"" with ""Reset"" (remove user-level connection file, read from system-level again).
replace ""Delete"" with ""Hide"" (similar to desktop entries in XDG autostart: write some parameter like 'hidden=true'  to connection file to hide this connection)",True,{}

the point about to minimize the toolbar in fullscreen mode, is because of my scenario. I am using Remmina on a ThinClient based on Debian Raspberry Pi 3 terminals.
I wanted to have all the control and prevent users to change everything, just click on an desktop icon, launch remmina with -c command and show their remote virtualised desktop for each user. In my company I am working to virtualize everything and change all computers and install raspberry as thinclient with remmina.
The thing is, depends of the scenario in some cases is useful to have all the original icons and functionalities on toolbar fullscreen, but in other cases is necessary to limit access to this, in the same way I can clear all keyboard commands in settings, change it and clear if I want for limited users.
It would be perfect to have the ability to choose what icons I want to put on the Connection Window Toolbar (fullscreen or not), in order to limit o allow full access to all funcionalitys (switch between fullscreen, exit without close session...)
So thats the point about the toolbar.
Thanks!",True,{}

If you are up to it it would be good to have a new tab in the remmina_pref_dialog.c with a checkbox for each icon.
Regarding the ""remmina quit"", on i3wm, when I quit the remmina_file_editor window and there is an already opened connection, nothing happens. How is implemented by your PR, we risk to receive some bug request because the Quit command does not work.
Some good behaviors would be:

Show a popup saying Remmina cannot be closed because there are opened connections.
Otherwise minimize the remmina_file_editor.
Otherwise, but this is quite complex, change completely the forking/threading model of Remmina.

Ideally is better to split this PR in two different ones, but at the moment we can keep this opened for discussion. As soon as @giox069 will have some time will comment with his thoughts as well.

Use the function to get the error message instead of the specified string","Thank you for the patch. Code seems to be fine.
The problem is only internationalization of strings. We cannot use libfreerdp strings (via freerdp_get_error_info_string()) for messages displayed the end user.
Strings returned by external functions have 2 problems:

They usally are not translated (freerdp has not translation files)
They cannot be extracted automatically for translation by xgettext tool.

So a better solution should be:
sprintf(buf, ""ERRINFO_DISCONNECTED_BY_OTHER_CONNECTION (0x%08""PRIX32"") %s"",
  ((FREERDP_ERROR_ERRINFO_CLASS << 16) | ERRINFO_DISCONNECTED_BY_OTHER_CONNECTION),
  _(""Another user connected to the server, forcing the disconnection of the current connection."")));

In the above code, xgettext will be able to find the message and then create the apposite entry in all our language translation (.po) files.
Also please note that an hex code on a message shown to a user is usually not a good idea, because the immediate reaction of the average user is ""I will not read it because I do not understand it, it's like reading an unknown alphabet"".
If a more advanced user will need more information, he/she just need to run remmina from a terminal window and get hex code which will be shown by libfreerdp itself.
So, IMHO I will remove hex code and macro name too. It's just unknown alphabet for 80% of readers and they will never read the true message content which follows macro name and hex code.",True,"{'THUMBS_UP': ['https://github.com/nanxiongchao', 'https://github.com/jinguojie-loongson']}"

For writing is OK space is inserted but for other do not works, only mouse help in that cases!
The accented characters (áéíóúü) was working very well before, but not now! I press accent key once, after letter vocal and only writes the letter vocal not accented. If I press accent key twice retuns two apostrophes (I do not know if anothers users have same problem).

Whenever I try and access the preferences dialog Remmina appears to crash:
(remmina:27527): Gtk-ERROR **: failed to add UI: /opt/remmina_devel/remmina/share/remmina/ui/remmina_preferences.glade:1398:59 Invalid property: GtkColorButton.show_editor
Trace/breakpoint trap

I followed these instructions to compile:
https://github.com/FreeRDP/Remmina/wiki/Compile-on-Ubuntu-16.04
However instead of next I cloned color_schemes using:
git clone https://github.com/FreeRDP/Remmina.git -b color_schemes

I'm happy to do some more testing.

A default theme is loaded during the first remmina startup inside the remmina.pref file.
You can set a new scheme in different ways.

Using the import widget in the Remmina preferences dialog.

You can download Remmina color scheme files from https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes


Create one using the color editor in the Remmina preferences dialog


The geek way, editing the file ~/config/remmina/remmina.colors


With the following syntax:

color0 =  #20111b

Please test and let me know.","Yes the latest build allows the preferences to be opened.
However for some reason nothing in the preferences menu is being saved.
For example, starting with a blank config:
troylea@E4300-Linux-Mint ~ $ rm ./.config/remmina/remmina.pref 
troylea@E4300-Linux-Mint ~ $ ls -la ./.config/remmina/remmina.pref 
ls: cannot access './.config/remmina/remmina.pref': No such file or directory

Then I open remmina in another terminal.
I open the preferences menu and change an option like ""Use system default font"" and click close.
I open the preferences menu again and the option I changed has not been saved.
I exit remmina.
Here is the terminal output:
troylea@E4300-Linux-Mint ~/remmina_devel/Remmina $ remmina
StatusNotifier/Appindicator support: not supported by desktop. libappindicator will try to fallback to GtkStatusIcon/xembed

(remmina:7579): Gtk-WARNING **: gtk_menu_attach_to_widget(): menu already attached to GtkMenuItem

(remmina:7579): Gdk-CRITICAL **: gdk_window_thaw_toplevel_updates: assertion 'window->update_and_descendants_freeze_count > 0' failed
****

You can see the config file was re-created:
troylea@E4300-Linux-Mint ~ $ ls -la ./.config/remmina/remmina.pref 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 troylea troylea 1707 Sep 14 18:39 ./.config/remmina/remmina.pref

The timestamp on the file changes when I open remmina and change another setting but the setting isn't remembered.

I've played around a bit and have some observations:

Cursor Color doesn't seem to work
Use System Theme Colors

Doesn't seem to do anything
When checked, the next time you go into preferences the Foreground and Background color can't be changed (which is fine) however when you uncheck the box you can't change them, you must close and open preferences again",True,{}

A default theme is loaded during the first remmina startup inside the remmina.pref file.
You can set a new scheme in different ways.

Using the import widget in the Remmina preferences dialog.

You can download Remmina color scheme files from https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes


Create one using the color editor in the Remmina preferences dialog


The geek way, editing the file ~/config/remmina/remmina.colors


With the following syntax:
[ssh_colors]
background = #d5ccba
cursor = #45373c
foreground = #45373c
color0 =  #20111b
color1 = #be100e
color2 = #858162
color3 = #eaa549
color4 = #426a79
color5 = #97522c
color6 = #989a9c
color7 = #968c83
color8 = #5e5252
color9 = #be100e
color10 = #858162
color11 = #eaa549
color12 = #426a79
color13 = #97522c
color14 = #989a9c
color15 = #d5ccba

Or you can use the rgb colors, like (careful this custom theme it's awful)
[ssh_colors]
background=rgb(156,151,204)
cursor=rgb(112,130,132)
foreground=rgb(250,91,138)
color0=rgb(0,40,49)

color2=rgb(115,138,5)
color3=rgb(165,119,6)
color4=rgb(33,118,199)
color5=rgb(198,28,111)
color6=rgb(83,88,55)
color7=rgb(234,227,203)
color8=rgb(0,30,39)
color9=rgb(189,54,19)
color10=rgb(151,255,112)
color11=rgb(83,104,112)
color12=rgb(112,130,132)
color13=rgb(89,86,186)

Usually in other software there is the msgid ""translator-credits"" so translators can add them self in the file.
#: remmina/src/remmina_about.c:54
msgid ""translator-credits""
msgstr """"
""Launchpad Contributions:\n""
""  Joe Hansen https://launchpad.net/~joedalton2\n""
""  Niels Kristensen https://launchpad.net/~nielskri\n""
""  Vic https://launchpad.net/~llyzs\n""
""scootergrisen""

But here is says translator_credits in the code already filled in with others names.
Should this perhaps be empty and filled in with the string from above when using danish language?
    <property name=""translator_credits"" translatable=""yes"">Adolfo Jayme Barrientos &lt;fitojb@ubuntu.com&gt;
Antenore Gatta &lt;antenore@simbiosi.org&gt;
Emmanuel Grognet &lt;emmanuel@grognet.fr&gt;

Shuhrat Dehkanov &lt;k@efir.uz&gt;
llyzs &lt;llyzs.vic@gmail.com&gt;
Johannes Weberhofer &lt;jweberhofer@weberhofer.at&gt;
</property>

Which might be taken from the following.
Is seems not optimal to have this string in the PO files.
There is no comment on what to do here.
#: remmina/ui/remmina_about.glade:117
msgid """"

In other software they only show the string/names from msgid ""translator-credits"" for the currently selected language.
So if i use Remmina with danish language i will only see the names of the people that contributed to the danish translated.",True,{}

Seems this patch is still not ideal. E.g. there are situations when first call to ssh_userauth_publickey_auto ends up with a timeout (e.g. server is temporary busy), it will raise a passphrase prompt window (which is unrelated in this given situation).
Looks like there is no nice way to determine if passphrase is set or not yet. Here are some more thoughts on this issue: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/129724/how-to-check-if-an-ssh-private-key-has-passphrase-or-not.",True,{}

There are 2 issues for the translations

The PO files are probably not updated with the last strings

You can update it following the wiki https://github.com/FreeRDP/Remmina/wiki/Update-gettext-messages

It could be in the code there are still not translatable strings.

In this case someone should update those strings. An example of what a translatable string looks like is https://github.com/FreeRDP/Remmina/blob/next/remmina/src/remmina_connection_window.c#L533 except for debug strings, that we prefer to keep in plain (macaroni) English :-)

One thought, recently we have removed the snap build from travis, because it was taking too long and often going in timeout.

Work Product does not include Customer’s pre-existing intellectual property or data. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Service Agreement and the applicable license agreement governing Customer’s use of GitLab’s software, and expressly conditioned on Customer’s compliance with the terms of such agreements, GitLab grants Customer a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable license (without the right to sublease or sublicense) to use and copy for use the Work Product for Customer’s own, internal computing operations.
1.3 Scheduling of Services. The parties will work together to determine a mutually agreed upon schedule based on the availability of GitLab resources and the agreed-upon project timeline. Services are non- cancellable. Accordingly, upon execution of an SOW, Customer will be liable for the entire amount quoted under the SOW.
2. Payment and Taxes
2.1 Payment. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable SOW, GitLab will invoice Customer for all Services and applicable charges, as GitLab renders the Services or charges are incurred, as applicable.

3.2 The Receiving Party agrees: (i) not to divulge to any third person any such Proprietary Information, (ii) to give access to such Proprietary Information solely to those employees with a need to have access thereto for purposes of this Service Agreement, and (iii) to take the same security precautions to protect against disclosure or unauthorized use of such Proprietary Information that the party takes with its own proprietary information, but in no event will a party apply less than reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information. The Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing will not apply with respect to any information that the Receiving Party can document (a) is or becomes generally available to the public without any action by, or involvement of, the Receiving Party, or (b) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (c) was rightfully disclosed to it without restriction by a third party, or (d) was independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party. Nothing in this Service Agreement will prevent the Receiving Party from disclosing Proprietary Information pursuant to any judicial or governmental order, provided that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party reasonable prior notice of such disclosure to contest such order.
3.3 Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other may suffer irreparable damage in the event of a breach of the terms of Section 3of this Service Agreement and that such party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief (without the necessity of posting a bond) in the event of any such breach.

In fact, I jave started yesterday on working on the X2Go plugin for Remmina. I used the work you started some years ago. The X2Go project received some funding to make that happen.

I would actually like to ping you on this later today or this week. The plugin code I have now embeds nicely in pre 1.3.0 Remmina whereas it segfaults after the commit which made the RCW appear before plugin connection. Maybe you have an idea about this.
