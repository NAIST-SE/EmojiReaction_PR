Could you replace this demo with the version attached to this email in the new Demos directory? The old version wrote 10000 txt files (each 255KB) into the Compucell3d directory. This version writes to the projects output dir and only generate 10 files.



This goes in the demos directory:

…\Demos\SteppableDemos\secretion_total_count\

(Note that the CC3D job file names don’t match the directory name)

Another issue, even if you do initialization what does it buy you? If you are using global settings from XML then by definition you will not be calling energy function that uses cell->targetVolume. In fact you confuse users who would think that volume plugin is indeed using cell->targetVolume.
Another point what if I change XML while simulation runs (known as steering) To be consistent I would also need to rerun  initialize_target_volume.
If I were a user and I saw cell->targetVolume=28 but plugin calculated energies as if targetVolume was 15 then I would be confused and I can easily create such situation with CC3D.

If I've understood this correctly, then there would only be the cell data parameters for constraint and coefficient, and no type-specific list maintained by the plugin. Is that correct?
If so, I'm inclined to agree in the sense that computations should be done by accessing parameters by cell, rather than by using cell type as a key to a global list. In my opinion, much of the strength of the framework is being able to edit parameters by cell in Python. I would only keep the parameter data by type in the plugin as a reference for memory purposes (not computer memory) so that, say, a cell's parameters could be reset to the defined parameters by cell type on-the-fly.
But in general, I think that parameter operations should be done at the level of the cell, and not the type. Granted, it requires more memory, but I think it's worth it.",True,{}

Current Issues

Update launch scripts and install package as necessary for conda environment","Adding boolean networks is great. We needed them for a long time and I know other users have been implementing them by hand. I admit I have not gone through entire code but I have few questions:

is there an option to compile CC3D without MaBoSS? Let's say the user faces compilation issues on their operating system but they do not need boolean network. Can we somehow disable compilation? BTW this is the only reason I am asking this question
Would it be possible to use  similar approach as we did with roadrunner/ antimony integration? I.e. we provide ""hooks"" for integrating MaBoSS but pyMaBoSS is compiled separately from CC3D? What I am hinting here is possibility to include in CC3D only code that is written by us and have all 3rd party additions be compiled separately and integrated ""at the Python level""


I've revised the description of the PR according to recent development. The extensions PR allows for selective installation of the MaBoSS extension, and the built-in support implemented in this PR handles when the extension is missing.
@CompuCell3D I completely agree with you about migrating all 3rd party code out, and only include built-in supporting features here. I'm planning to migrate the RoadRunner and Antimony integrations to the extensions repo as simple metapackages, for now, and we can think about a tighter integration when opportune. I would also like to do similar restructuring for Player and Twedit.",True,{}
