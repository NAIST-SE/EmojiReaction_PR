changes from emlib
================ Revision history ============================================
4.3.0:

em_cmu: Removed unused fields from CMU_HFXOInit_TypeDef. The removed fields
are regIshStartup and timeoutWarmSteady.
em_rtc.h: Added RTC_CounterSet function for modifying the RTC Counter.
em_burtc.c: Fixed bug when doing low frequency domain synchronization.
em_gpio.c: Deprecated GPIO_IntConfig(), use new function GPIO_ExtIntConfig()
instead.
Removed deprecated file em_part.h.
em_dma.c: Replaced infinite loop on bus errors in default irq handler with
an assert.
em_gpio.c: Use direct register write instead of BUS API in GPIO_PinModeSet
to prevent glitches.
Fixed incorrect handling of CMU_CTRL_WSHFLE and CMU_HFPRESC_HFCLKLEPRESC in
em_cmu.c for EFM32 Pearl and Jade Gecko.
Type enumerations cmuClock_HFLE and cmuSelect_HFCLKLE can now be used for
all families to select or reference the divided down HF clock for LE peripherals.
Code size optimization in em_cmu.c.
Added GPCRC support.
Added support for WARNSEL, WINSEL and WDOGRSTDIS to em_wdog. Added interrupt
functions. Added support for multiple WDOG instances. Deprecated functions
WDOG_Enable(), WDOG_Feed(), WDOG_Init() and WDOG_Lock().
GPIO_EM4GetPinWakeupCause() now returns the content of the EM4WU field from
the GPIO_IF register for platform 2 devices.
Added function GPIO_SlewrateSet() to set slewrate for GPIO ports.
Added fix for GPIO_E201 in CHIP_Init().
Added function CMU_HFRCOBandGet() and CMU_HFRCOBandSet() for platform 2.
Functions with the same names are present for platform 1, but the parameter
and return types are different. Platform 1 and 2 also do not support the same
HFRCO/AUXHFRCO frequencies.
Added HFLE wait-state control to CMU_HFRCOBandSet(). This is a bug on
EFM32 Wonder Gecko only as HFLE DIV4 is required at 24MHz, in between the 28HMz
and 21MHz HFRCO bands.
Fixed reset-cause XMASKs for platform 2, gen 1 parts. Improved
documentation in em_rmu.c.
Added support for configuring IrDA on USART1 for EFM32 Happy Gecko. The
function USART_InitIrDA() is deprecated, and replaced by USARTn_InitIrDA().
Added module em_ramfunc. Fixed issue with calls from em_msc RAM code to Flash.
Updated current limiter threshold equations for LNCLIMILIMSEL, LPCLIMILIMSEL
and DCDCZDETCTRL.
Member type EMU_DcdcLnTransientMode_TypeDef in EMU_DCDCInit_TypeDef changed to
EMU_DcdcLnReverseCurrentControl_TypeDef to enable support for reverse current
limiter.
EM2/3 current consumption optimization: Default value
emuDcdcAnaPeripheralPower_AVDD in EMU_DCDCINIT_DEFAULT for EFR32
changed to emuDcdcAnaPeripheralPower_DCDC.
EM2/3 current consumption optimization: DCDC_LP_NFET_CNT updated to 7.

4.2.1:

Added errata fix for an issue that may cause BOD resets in EM2 when using
DCDC-to-DVDD mode. The fix is implemented in EMU_DCDCInit().
Added function EMU_DCDCPowerOff() for boards with physically disconnected DCDC.
Current consumption is optimized for DCDC bypass mode. This update is
implemented in EMU_DCDCInit().

4.2.0:

Updated I2C clock divider equation for platform 2 parts. Added constraints
to HFPER clock frequency in I2C_BusFreqSet().
EMU EMU_EM23VregMode_TypeDef replaced with a bool.
Added support for GPIO alternate drive strength and alternate control modes.
DCDC setup is simplified. More tuning and optimization settings added to
EMU_DCDCInit().
Added member pinRetentionMode to EMU_EM4Init_TypeDef.
Added function EMU_UnlatchPinRetention() to support unlatching of pin
retention in EM4H/S.
Fixed bug in ADC_InitScan() which caused a overwrite of single conversion
mode calibration values.
Added support for CRYPTO module on EFM32 Pearl and Jade Gecko (em_crypto.c/h).

4.1.1:

EMU_DCDCInit() updated with new parameters for EM2 and 3. Current consumption
with DCDC at expected levels for EFR32 and EFM32 Pearl and Jade Gecko.
EMU_DCDCInit_TypeDef updated with more parameters. EMU_DcdcLpcmpBiasMode_TypeDef
is removed.
More assertions added to EMU_DCDCInit().
HFXO default parameters updated.
ADC defaults updated.
RMU pin mode set fixed.
Added missing define for cmuSelect_ULFRCO.
Added missing functions for handling peripheral interrupts.
Added support for VMON.

4.1.0:

New signature for RMU_ResetControl() function.
The typedef EMU_EM23Init_TypeDef which is a parameter to EMU_EM23Init()
has got a new definition.
Initial support _SILICON_LABS_32B_PLATFORM_2 devices added.

This change is","Few general comments:

Try to follow general repository structure

Move the spi & dma drivers separate libraries and put them in libs/external directory
Move gyro driver out of main module and put it in its own library in libs/drivers directory


Gyro driver public interface is not is not fully documented.
There are not automatic tests of any kind in here
The Gyro driver is very tightly coupled to the SPI driver which is not the best solution.
Please do not use global variables
Check source code formatting agains our coding standard
Use C99 integer types from stdint.h header files instead of built-in integer types they are better at signalizing original intent and expected data range
Try to use OS abstraction layer from libs/base instad of calling FreeRTOS directly",True,{}

changes from emlib
================ Revision history ============================================
4.3.0:
em_cmu: Removed unused fields from CMU_HFXOInit_TypeDef. The removed fields are regIshStartup and timeoutWarmSteady.
em_rtc.h: Added RTC_CounterSet function for modifying the RTC Counter.
em_burtc.c: Fixed bug when doing low frequency domain synchronization.
em_gpio.c: Deprecated GPIO_IntConfig(), use new function GPIO_ExtIntConfig() instead.
Removed deprecated file em_part.h.
em_dma.c: Replaced infinite loop on bus errors in default irq handler with an assert.
em_gpio.c: Use direct register write instead of BUS API in GPIO_PinModeSet to prevent glitches.
Fixed incorrect handling of CMU_CTRL_WSHFLE and CMU_HFPRESC_HFCLKLEPRESC in em_cmu.c for EFM32 Pearl and Jade Gecko.
Type enumerations cmuClock_HFLE and cmuSelect_HFCLKLE can now be used for all families to select or reference the divided down HF clock for LE peripherals.
Code size optimization in em_cmu.c.
Added GPCRC support.
Added support for WARNSEL, WINSEL and WDOGRSTDIS to em_wdog. Added interrupt functions. Added support for multiple WDOG instances. Deprecated functions WDOG_Enable(), WDOG_Feed(), WDOG_Init() and WDOG_Lock().

Known issues:

I don't like the idea of checking GetLastError when operation fails. Any other ideas are welcome","The structure of the file system driver IMHO should be updated as right now everything beneath the file system driver is closely coupled together despite several existing interfaces.
Right now the file system driver is structured like this:
FileSystem (fs library) 
  -> yaffs (external 
    -> yaffs_os_glue (fs library)
    -> Nand Driver (fs library) 
      -> FlashNandInterface (storage library)

Via direct function calls the FileSystem main interface is tied directly to the Nand driver that is part of the fs library. Additionally the Nand driver itself is closely tied to the FlashNandInterface that is part of the storage library. And as a result both libraries have to be treated as one and the fs library cannot be used without storage library.
It would be better if the storage library existed as an interface the provides common interface for NAND/NOR flash drivers.
The Nand driver should not be part of the fs library. Instead it should be placed in the separate library along with its own dedicated Flash Driver. I am not sure though how universal the current Flash driver is (FlashNandInterface) but I don't think that it can be reused in its current form for the NOR flash memory please correct me on that if I am wrong.
The fs library should not be aware what type of memory it actually uses instead it should receive pointer to the interface that provides the low level flash capabilities.",True,{}

I don't like the idea of non canonical state. It will force to normalize it everytime it's needed. I would prefer API similar to .NET TimeSpan (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/system.timespan(v=vs.110).aspx): object is immutable, can be created by factory functions like FromMinutes. Modification is done by functions like AddMinutes, AddTimeSpan and they make sure that TimePoint is still valid

src/main.c, line 116 [r1] (raw file):

We need to think about seperating initialization to other file(s).  Doesn't need to be done now. Leaving note just to remember

I don't like idea of callbacks here. This code will execute in context of other task and, for me, it's not necessary complication - it should be enough to give semaphore to release or event bit.

unit_tests/mock/FsMock.hpp, line 1 [r1] (raw file):

It would be nicer to have more intelligent FS mock that will mimic real file system. It could be dead-simple like array with file name and buffer so it test it will be possible to assert file contents without mocking individual file system functions

Maybe contraints for TimePoints allowing to write ASSERT_THAT(TimePointBuild(...), EqTimePoint(...))?

Pulse all is a concept that can be build on top of the EventGroups, I would go for the element built on top of our very think os abstraction rather than try to make it more robust.

I would prefer i2c driver interface that will not limit us to any arbitrary number of i2c busses.
To be reconsidered:

Should irq handler entry points  be defined inside the driver itself
Should the i2c driver decide how many there are busses availble

libs/drivers/comm/comm.c, line 46 at r1 (raw file):

Previously, zaq32 (Łukasz Żak) wrote…

Comm should not be aware how many i2c busses are there and which one it uses. In fact Only the main module should now how many i2c busses are there.

To be honest I've got a bit small dilema about how both buses will be used and what should be placed in driver and what in specific devices. 


libs/drivers/eps/eps.c, line 17 at r1 (raw file):

Previously, zaq32 (Łukasz Żak) wrote…

Do not use global variables unless absolutely necessary.

EPS driver is still very-very-draft, will be updated when EPS ICD is (better) known


libs/drivers/i2c/i2c.c, line 10 at r1 (raw file):

Previously, zaq32 (Łukasz Żak) wrote…

This should be defined in main module not i2c driver.

Done.


libs/drivers/i2c/i2c.c, line 51 at r1 (raw file):

Previously, zaq32 (Łukasz Żak) wrote…

if there is no response on i2c bus the driver will hang here. We need timeout here to prevent that.

Will be done later


libs/drivers/i2c/i2c.c, line 131 at r1 (raw file):

Previously, zaq32 (Łukasz Żak) wrote…

Possible buffer overflow.

Done.


libs/drivers/i2c/i2c.c, line 137 at r1 (raw file):

Previously, zaq32 (Łukasz Żak) wrote…

I would prefer i2c driver interface that will not limit us to any arbitrary number of i2c busses.
To be reconsidered:

Should irq handler entry points  be defined inside the driver itself
Should the i2c driver decide how many there are busses availble

Done.

Each device has two interfaces: API for tests and methods called via I2C. I think it would be beneficial to separete these two interfaces, for example by preceding them with _ as they are not intended to be invoked by tests

it's only about reading logs in case of tests error, all you get is 'Expected True actual: False' and you have to dig into code to find issue. I want meaningful messages in tests like 'Expected antenna 1 deployment to be in progress'

My question was not about the order of parameters but the logic. Documentation says that the whole method TimeLongDelayUntil should return true IF desired time is achieved. This commented IF is something I dont understand why we compare desired time with mission time and we return true from it (as we need to wait to achieve desired time? as next IF checks that?)

So I believe (if I correctly understand, but it seems I do not ;)) that we should check
if desiredTime >= currentTime and then return from that loop (true)? as it would mean we achieved desired time?

`TimeLongDelayUntil` waits until time is achived (e.g. 5 minutes). It is done by checking mission time after each timer tick. 

It is possible that after tick, mission time and desired time are equal (second IF). More likely desired time will be between ticks, so wait will be a little long (up to tick length), so we need to check if mission time is after desired time.
Condition desiredTime >= currentTime, means that currentTime is before desiredTime, exiting in that condition will be cause no wait at all

3 is as good as any other value. Some value must be returned but is has no significance in case of unit testing.

TimerTest is name of test fixture with tests related to keeping track of mission time

Because timer code is using semaphores but testing failures of these actions are not point of this tests, so it is easier to setup semaphore related functions to return  success

using `gsl::span` will require changes to comm low-level driver that I'm not so sure (at least now). Currently Method `CommObject::ReceiveFrame` is filling frame object that is passed as reference. Buffer for received data is local, so span will be referencing local variable
Changed that to std::array.

NULL comes from C and has not type which makes it easy to misuse due to the hack in the C & C++ standards. nullptr on the other hand has its own type and cannot be misused therefore it preferable. Both are still fine. In new code prefer using nullptr in already existing one I leave it up to you

I used std::move so that Option<T> can be constructed from rvalue references - which makes sense as long as it's used for returning value.  I had problem adopting std::forward, because for lvalue references passed to factory method (the one in global scope) the type argument is deducted as T&. As far as I understand this is a problem when returning value.
But I could got it wrong ;-)

for consistency reason I would provide also function for read command.

Actually it's not that easy - most read commands will require more that single byte so some complex matcher is requried (like ElementsAre(someCommand, someAddress))  and to be honest I'm not so happy with ExpectWriteCommand in it's current form - it's a bit to strict (only one byte) for general use.
I'll think of something better

Mounting file system can take long time (up to 30-40 seconds). Syncing file system forces YAFFS to write checkpoint information speeding up next mount significally (40sec -> 0.1sec)

if there is no other way I can accept active register polling, but I would recommend at least sleeping for 0-1 ms (exact value TBD) during the iterations or at least yielding the task control so one task will not over-zealously block tasks with lover priority while not doing anything useful.

raw struct like this may be useful but it is very easy to accidentally left it uninitialized. Add at least:

parametrized constructor that initializes all fields.

I'd limit the number of possible nested calls (due to uncertain stack requirements) and in such case fallback to full driver erase.

I rather thought of moving the TimeSpan type from time library to base so OS layer can use it.  This way it still is integer with no semantic meaning.

this will of course work but it would be much more readable if you put those declarations in a structs that

    NotCopyAble& operator=(const NotCopyable& arg) = delete;

And simply private inherit from those.

Since external access to those fields is not desirable I would recommend putting them in private section.

	obc_storage

This is interesting. We have obc_storage library that is linked to this library & at the same time this library is linked to obc storage. As a result we have logical circular dependency something that should not have happened.
I recommend doing something like this:

dropp the obc_storage_* -> obc_storage dependency
Make the OBCStorage class a template that is instantiated on different specific driver type based on build on build option:
to do that you would have to change the class OBCStorage into something like this:

 template <typename MemDriver> class OBCStorageHandler final
{
public:
    OBCStorageHandler (drivers::spi::ISPIInterface& spi, FileSystem& fs) :
        driver(spi, fs)
    {
    }

    void Initialize()
    {
        this->driver.Initialize();
    }

    OSResult ClearStorage()
    {
        return this->driver.ClearStorage();
    }
    
    OSResult Erase()
    {
        return this->driver.Erase();
    }
    
private:
    MemDriver driver;

};

and then finally:
#ifdef USE_EXTERNAL_FLASH
    #include ""n25q.hpp""
    
    typedef OBCStorage<N25QProvider> OBCStorage;
#else
    #include ""nand.h""
    
    typedef OBCStorage<NANDProvider> OBCStorage;
#endif

This way you have single common interface without the convoluted dependency graph. However this is a suggestion and not the only solution to this situation....

this is true but my point here is that you do not need template <> in front of this function declaration.

The overall mechanism works as expected but this mechanism leaves something to be desired. As any new ping set (i.e. cameras, additional chip select pins) will require updating this implementation.

When working with some periperhal (like USART1) you need to know few another constant/registers like clock (cmuClock_USART1), DMA signals (USART1_TXBL). peripheral is configured in io_map but putting there all these constants will just make that file less readable, so I created few constexprs to resolve that dependant constants. I can't put is in emlib as another file as some constants (DMA signals) comes from emdrv

I am afraid not current implementation is actually worse than the original one as contains the resource leak plus it has unintended side effect of leaving the resource File object in invalid state.
Take the first example:
File foo = File::Open(/* ... */);   // (1)
foo = File::Open(/* ... */);          // (2)

at line 1 we have valid opened file which is indicated by the _handle member set to to some value lets use symbol A for it.
so at line 1 we have
foo:
_handle : A
_valid : true

now we at line 2 we are opening the new file. The File::Open is returning another File object which is move assigned to the foo variable. At the point of assignment in line two we have:
foo: 
_handle: A
_valid: true

<temporary>:
_handle: B
_valid: true

Now we enter the move assignment operator where this points to foo and other is bound to <temporary>
Lets see what happens inside the operator:
this->_handle = other._handle;        // foo->_handle <- B   the handle with value A is leaked here (!!!)
this->_valid = other._valid;          // foo->_valid <- true   
this->_fs = other._fs;                // this line is subject for another discussion
// here is where it gets very interesting
other._handle = this->_handle;       // <temporary>->_handle <- foo->_handle which is at this point B as it was set two line above
other._valid = this->_valid;         // <temporary>->_valid <- foo->_valid 
other._fs = this->_fs;

so after the assignment and before end of this line we have following situation:
foo: 
_handle: B
_valid: true

<temporary>:
_handle: B
_valid: true

and what happens now is the destructor for the <temporary> gets called which closes the resource B(!!!) as a result we end up with leaked file handle A and foo object that uses already destroyed file handle B.

This is not necessarily what I have suggested. Since 0 has been used to indicate that handle is not valid the value of the _valid member can be inferred by checking if the _handle member is set to 0 as a result the _valid member can be completely removed.

File::File(File&& other) noexcept : _fs(other._fs), _handle(other._handle), _valid(other._valid)

see my comment regarding move assignment operator. This constructor is now suffering for the same issue.

File needs reference to IFileSystem which cannot be set to some 'empty' value

Since it is a reference the File type should not be moveable as well because it is not possible to redirect once initialized reference.
Consider this:
int a = 1;
int& b = a;
int* c = &a;
int d = 4;

now b = d; is semantically equal to the *c = d;
Also the redirection possible with pointers like this: c = &d; is not possible to replicate with references.
The reason why the _fs member assignment works at all in the move constructor is caused only by the fact that in current system _fs in both source & the target variables will always point to the same service. However you will quickly start seeing unintended side effects once you start using several file system services.

Sort-of equivalent - it needs size of data to read. What I need is reading everything up to the end of buffer so they are similar but not the same

And you can get the size by calling the RemainingSize() procedure. Why add (and maintain) function when it can be easily replicated by using already existing interface?

It's our code and I would like to have interface that serves our needs: Remaining() is a lot more readable than ReadArray(RemainingSize().
In case of such small functions I think that we just spent more time discussing it than we will ever spent on maintaining it.

Writer used in ctor to writer header is different writer, payload writer works only on payload part of frame, so the final frame size is header + payload size.
I was thinking about using the same writer for header and payload but in case that we add some method to writer that seeks it to the begining of span than it will overwrite header.  Also if any upper level code asks for current size of written data, it will be fooled by additional 3 bytes

 * @brief Class that can logically contain either a value of type T or no value.

A side note (I'm not going to argue about this).
For classes like this it would be better to implement == and != operator as non member free standing functions.
To understand why consider this:
Option<int> a = 5;
int b  = 5;

const auto r1 = a == b;           // works ok 
const auto r2 = b == a;           // compile time error as ther is no equality operator that with first argument T and second Option<T>

     */
    static Option<T> Some(T&& value)

Again side note.
From pure language point of view this signature is less then optimal as it does not allow in-place object construction.
Something like this wold be preferable:
template <typename... Args> Option<T> Some(Args&&... args)
{
    return Option<T>(true, std::forward<Args>(args)...);

Timeprovider depends on File system that is initialized in PostStartInitialization ;)
To be honest it would be best to think about initialization procedure as it is messy - part is done in main() some in task directly, something else is delegated to OBC structure.

There is definitely something to be said about clean & simple startup routine, plus besides the usual hardware/software initialization we have to put somewhere here the general self/test state assessment routine. For the moment I think this will do, and entire startup procedure will be topic of our next workshop anyway.

if there was an error then there is no point to read anything.


Is this a problem? Having separate if for returning false won't simplify the code, neither will speed up anything.

How are you going to differentiate Current from Dipole from Temperature?


By using correct function, not by type. It will cause too much bloat have separate type defined for every measurement. Fortunately this kind of error is very simple to detect even in case of any bug.

I think it will be more readable if each condition will be separate, like:
if(!state.Antenna.Deployed) return false;
if(..) return false;

return true;

But that just my opinion ;)

How about like this?

I do not like the idea of monotonic counters that can only be increased or reset to zero.

I believe the error counters should be slowly decreased (with zero cut off) in case of the successful communication.

virtual destructor is useful only when you are planning to be able to destroy object via pointer to the base class. Since we do not destroy our objects at all this seems unused.

It would be better suited to provide an RTC interface so it can be abstracted away instead of making it overrideable.

That may be hard to resolve - Hardware depends on TimeProvider, RTC depends on Hardware.  I think we'd have redesign the obc structure - i.e. look also at adcs, antenna drivers etc

I don't think that it's needed to manage dirty flag of persistant state. Dumping it in each mission loop iteration won't slow it down (it should took about 40ms for whole 32KB)  and FRAM memory can't be damaged by too many writes (well, it can after 85 years of constant writes with 20MHz). in addition more frequent writes will prevent errors (maybe we will be able to skip scrubbing of FRAM)

libs/state/Include/state/PersistentState.hpp, line 26 at r3 (raw file):

     * @endcode
     */
    template <typename... Parts> class PersistentState

It would be wise to add some static_asserts:

that types are unique (git merge may went wrong and one line will get duplicated)
total size is smaller that maximum FRAM size (32KB)

    inline constexpr std::uint32_t TimeState::Size()

count() is returning value of type rep (typedef inside duration), so this can be written as sizeof(decltype(lastMissionType)::rep) + sizeof(decltype(lastExternalTime)::rep)

The idea is to have all internal processing and constants (such as Registers)  to not be exposed in the header. Header is now only high-level interface, and all actions are defined in .cpp file.

That's different approach that we've taken with other drivers but I will not argue as this is not essential driver

The idea is to put the algorithm parameters in obc's persistent state which will allow us to modify them after the launch if need arises. Therefore the parameters type should be default constructible. Also the default constructed object should contain valid configuration that can be used to run the algorithm. Preferably this should be default algorithm configuration.

@zaq32: I don't think those parameters should be in persistent state. They should be send from earth in telecommand which will enable this detumbling mode - and there is no point for wasting persistent (FRAM/FLASH) memory for storing them as this algorithm will be never invoked ""by its own"". Some parameters are constant (e.g. time step) but rest has to be send in the proper TC.

doc/Runlevels.md, line 28 at r1 (raw file):

## How-to: staying on bootloader runlevel
During startup bootloader checks if pin @ref obc::OBCGPIO::SysClear is low (*TBC*). If not, normal boot procedure is executed up to run level 3. When that pin is low during startup, OBC stays in bootloader for T<sub>boot_timeout</sub> (*TBD*) seconds waiting for commands from terminal. If no command is entered in T<sub>boot\_timeout</sub> than normal boot precedure is performed.

For now on access port we have only one UART for OBC. We can add GPIO pin to fullfil this requirement but IMO it will be better to wait for UART command (similar mechanism as in bootloader). This method can also reduce fault probability (it is easier to alter pin state than send proper command via UART).

For now on access port we have only one UART for OBC. We can add GPIO pin to fullfil this requirement but IMO it will be better to wait for UART command (similar mechanism as in bootloader). This method can also reduce fault probability (it is easier to alter pin state than send proper command via UART).

Done.

Will this pin be necessary on flight model? I understand that is will be helpful to speedup testing, but I don't see a usage for it on flight hardware. Maybe this should be explicitly written here?

We tried to measure it by:

increasing tick rate to 1000 Hz
removing this delay completely.

Unfortunately, removing it resulted in about 0.5ms delay between Write() and Read() and commands were executed successfully.
I don't know how to reduce the delay even more, but next time more test should be performed (e.g. sending 10k and searching for incorrect ones).

RedundantN25QDriver::WriteMemory will call BeginWritePage for all 3 chips and then wait for them to report that the operation is finished. As far I as understand it, page is writen first to chip buffer and we have to wait until chip finishes writing it to the flash storage. This allows us to initiate the writing on all 3 chips simultaneously

This is what you intended but it is not what actually happens. What happens right now is as follows:

OperationWaiter is created inside the BeginWritePage function. Lets call this object x.
return statement is being executed which will either copy or move (depending on the type & context, most likely move) object x to the outside object. Lets call it y.
Now object y contains a copy of the state of object x.
Destructor of object x is called, which calls Wait & it subsequently waits for write operation to finish
(several us later)
Destructor of object x finishes its execution
BeginWritePage function ends
user calls Wait on object y which tries to wait for the same operation to finish.

As you can see current implementation despite being intended as non blocking it is not. This makes every function call in fact fully synchronous.

Good point - I changed the OperationWaiter to support move semantics, I also added unit tests to make sure everything works as expected

Sending simple ""succeeded"" response won't do.  Due to the nature of the gs <-> obc communication we will not wait for the obc to respond to one TC before sending another.  threfore if a response is sent back it has to be constructed in such way that it is possible to map it to the specific request out of many that has been sent.

There should be one apid assigned to be a response for purely operational commands. If we assign every possible error its own apid we will soon run out of apids for experiments. Remeber that apids are only 6bit values.

I2CResult comes from i2c library, putting this operator into error counters library will make it dependant on i2c - which will be strange.

It is dependent as it checks if suppiled  types are valid telecommands. Stripping it from telecommands specifics won't give us any good

Yeah but my intention was to keep static assert stuff together (and putting it at the beginning of the class will 'hide' purpose of whole class)

I retained the original structure - description is loaded up to size or new line (whichever is receives first). When displaying it is displayed up to null terminator, new line character or maximum size

Partial telemetry is worse then not having it as there is no way of knowing which part is valid and which could not be acquired.

Not to my knowledge.  However this part of the telemetry acquisition mechanism will most likely not survive our next workshop.

The only reason is to be able to copy the object. In this case it is mostly just a habit.

On the other hand it would be beneficial for OPER to know everything and let it decide what is what but in case of COMM any error in getting telemetry from device will mean that there is no communication with GS at all

Disabled adcs is not an exception is normal operational state. this if will needlessly generate one log entry every second as long as adcs is not enabled. 
Also consider suspending this task altogether when adcs is disabled instead of waking it up once every second.

Disabled adcs is not an exception is normal operational state. this if will needlessly generate one log entry every second as long as adcs is not enabled.

Fixed. Logging is removed and I added task suspension. I don't know whether task can suspend itself, so I left the sleep there and added suspension to the method that creates this task.

Experimental detumbling algorithm is using floating point in it's frequency calculations. I changed GetFrequency to GetWait method, which returns milliseconds. Because frequencies are constexpr the wait time should be calculated during build. I would like to leave frequencies as the parameter, because all talks with ADCS guys mention frequencies instead of waiting time

I would like to test this implementation on real hardware before we will enable it by default.
The custom self test is written based on the emails from isis where they only give a hint on how it could be done.

Not as much as messing as you would have to provide your own constructors, destructor, assignment operators. Right now this type introduces unnecessary overhead of keeping/copying unused half of its state.

namespace state
{
    template <typename StatePolicy, typename... Parts> class LockablePersistentState : public PersistentState<StatePolicy, Parts...>

Although correct, implementation inheritance in here seems a bit strange. Without virtual interface there is a risk that one will use unsynchronized procedure from base class instead of its replacement from derived class. Can inheritance be replaced by the composition?

libs/state/Include/state/LockablePersistentState.hpp, line 90 at r6 (raw file):

        return Base::template Get<Object>();

Unfortunately this will not work as expected as this function does not copy the protected memory area it only returns reference (pointer) to it. Therefore by the time this function caller will try to access the object referenced by the reference returned from this function it will no longer have exclusive access to it as the lock created by this function will no longer be held.
For this to work the signature of this function has to be changed to this:
bool Get(Object& object)
{ 
    Lock lock(this->object);
    if(!lock)
    {
        return false;

I am curious why propagate error counting logic down the call stack instead of observing the top level operation results?

I observed that not every false is reason for incrementing error counters - i.e. if I2C fails then it's a good reason, but if send data buffer is empty then  we just do nothing.

This value is written only in OBC initialization and before COMM task (which reads this value) is resumed

I'm still thinking about how to approach errors (and what error there can be) during initialization - it easier to leave placeholders for statuses and than remove them than remove them in first place than add them again

It is used in two places: persistent store saving/reading (passed as argument to mission ctor) and cleaning persistent state on OBC startup (now inside obc.cpp).
Being here is provides simple answer for question 'Where in FRAM begins OBC state?'

Am I correct in assuming that obc will be launched with all six slots having a copy of the initial software?

If this block is not needed remove it.

boot/commands/upload.cpp, line 13 at r2 (raw file):

    // get boot index
    auto index = USART_Rx(BSP_UART_DEBUG);

Shouldn't this function use character as boot index instead of raw byte just like the ReadBootIndex() function?

I'd suggest keeping all the offsets in one place so they can be easily tracked. And initialize them in such way that the subsequent fields will never overlap.

     * @ingroup boot_settings

Add possibility to erase all settings.

16bit boot counter may not be enough

This will work but it will not give us information how many times boot process has failed. How about storing the  boot counter of last successful boot process.

Only slots will be switched, so next try will require just changing selected boot slots - no need to upload whole application again.

Strictly speaking it is not neccessary, but it does not have any negative impact and it is more resistant to future changes.

It was removed after discussion with Maciek, because currently it causes hardfault several lines of code later in scenario when Flash completely doesn't work or is not connected (like in my first setup without payload board), because it skips the rest of required initialization.
With return removed, at least OBC starts.

It's bad idea to relay on struct members order when reading response from any device. Normally we use following procedure:

Read response bytes into buffer
Use Reader to extract values from buffer into dedicated response structure

to read from the SunS you have to write a byte at first - a number of the first byte from the SunS register thet you want to read. Exactly the same as it is done in payload (pld and suns I2C communication use common protocol). In this case you probably want to write just 0 to fetch whole data from sensor.

The imtq telemetry collection is collected as the imtq driver is being used by different obc elements (mainly adcs plugins and/or experiments).  Mainly because of the following reasons:

adcs experimens (sunpointing/detumbling) are not very tolerant for unexpected unbounded delays in the middle that could be caused by the asynchronous process trying to collect telemetry.
it is difficult to collect imtq magnetometer measurements, b-dot & dipoles without knowing exact current imtq (adcs) operating mode. In case of imtq built-in detumbling they are acquired using get detumble data, however in case of experimental detumbling/sunpointing get detumble data cannot be used and those telemetry parts have to be acquired using other means.

Based on that the proxy layer for imtq drver has been implemented that captures the necessary telemetry elements as they are available and stored in the temporary storage.  The actual acquisition element only captures the telemetry from that temporary storage.
Additional small changes:

Replaced several small telemetry elements with single template based implementation & some typedefs with tags.

This is needed to remove duplicate frame types.
inspect.getmembers() returns inherited classes and for example:
class SetBitrateSuccessFrame(OperationSuccessFrame)

There were cases that version info was longer then downlink frame payload size. So I have added separate apid for version info and split entire information in two frames

It's not really needed, but we might want to be able to distinguish calls of the same command (eg. we didn't received response on time and resent the command).

Persistent state is internally synchronized. is there a reason to modifying it indirectly via mission task instead of directly from here?

libs/adcs/AdcsCoordinator.cpp, line 174 at r2 (raw file):

        const auto elapsed = System::GetUptime() - startTime;
        auto waitDuration = adcsProcessor->GetWait() - elapsed;

this is extremely rough calculation as it does not take into account the time spend in the loop in the Loop function. In effect the value returned by this function will be too big.

libs/adcs/AdcsCoordinator.cpp, line 185 at r2 (raw file):

    auto lastIterationTime = System::GetUptime();

    auto nextIterationAt = lastIterationTime;


This is way too complex than it has to be. In fact only one value is needed for proper calculation. Is there a purpose for having lastIterationTime?

libs/adcs/AdcsCoordinator.cpp, line 213 at r2 (raw file):

                if (currentTime >= nextIterationAt)

                }

                timeout = std::max(0ms, nextIterationAt - System::GetUptime());


consider this:
if(currentTime >= nextIterationAt)

    timeout = Run(mode);
    nextIterationAt += timeout;
}
else
{
    timeout = std::max(0ms, nextIterationAt - System::GetUptime());

This is of course assuming that we do not account for loop iteration in timeout calculation

use value that is slightly less then 10s or it will always be effectively two mission iterations. This applies to all wait times

            static constexpr AntennaTask::StepDescriptor Reset = {AntennaTask::Reset, Channel, AntennaId::ANTENNA_AUTO_ID, 0s, 60s};

This is insane, resetting the controller does not take 60s.

libs/mission/antenna/antenna.cpp, line 47 at r2 (raw file):

            static constexpr AntennaTask::StepDescriptor Arm = {AntennaTask::Arm, Channel, AntennaId::ANTENNA_AUTO_ID, 0s, 60s};

This is insane, Arming deployment system does not take 60s. If it takes more then 60ms something is wrong.

            /** @brief Perform manual deployment */
            template <AntennaId Antenna>
            static constexpr AntennaTask::StepDescriptor ManualDeploy = {AntennaTask::Deploy, Channel, Antenna, 30s, 90s};

This is insane, why wait time is three times bigger than burn time?

            /** @brief Perform full sequence of auto deployment */
            static constexpr auto FullSequenceAuto = std::make_tuple(PowerOn, Reset, Arm, AutoDeploy, Disarm, PowerOff);

If I am counting this right this single sequence takes at least 7m 10s to run.

If I am counting this right this single sequence takes at least 7m 10s to run.

            static constexpr auto FullSequenceManual = std::make_tuple(PowerOn, Reset, Arm, ManualDeploy<Antenna>, Disarm, PowerOff);

Powering off & on controller in the middle of the sequence effectively erases its state. Which effectively invalidates the purpose of collecting antenna telemetry

I prefer explicit checks for all negative conditions, than just returning true. That way every condition is single statement (a bit easier for read).

why do you think that this 500 ms delay will be harmful to the system? do you see any threats that we are not aware of?
setting this delay let's say 'globally' was menat to reduce workload needed for this change.
