This code was developed on a Mac running macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 where epoll() is not an option.  This code has not (yet) been submitted as an answer.
fifo-rdr-41.c
Code to read from a FIFO, repeatedly.
Default usage has no arguments; -h provides help, -r reopens the FIFO when EOF is detected; -w opens the FIFO for writing (but never writes to it) so EOF is never detected.
fifo-wrt-41.c
Code to write to a FIFO, a few times.
It sends a random number of messages, each of which is a random number of bytes long but consists of upper-case letters.  It pauses for a random time before sending each message, and also before it closes the FIFO.
It has no options, but configuring the random times would be an obvious option to use, as would adding options to send the contents of a file, etc.
What they demonstrate
However, the pair of programs demonstrates that:

You can't complete opening a FIFO for reading until there's a writer.
You can't complete opening a FIFO for writing until there's a reader.
While a process has the FIFO open for writing, a reader will block waiting for input, even if the process is itself.
If a reader gets EOF (0 bytes read), it can close the FIFO and reopen it; the open() call will wait until a new writer opens the FIFO.
If there is no writer, the reader will hang in a busy loop continually reading no bytes, unless the code takes step to avoid it.

Notes
The code includes a random_milli_nap() function which takes a minimum and maximum nap time in milliseconds and waits for a random time in that interval.  It uses rand(); it would not be hard to upgrade it to use a separate PRNG (so as not to interfere with other random number sequences).
The code includes some semi-useful signal handling.  It uses stderr.c and stderr.h from src/libsoq because that simplifies error reporting.","The question asks about epoll(), which is specific to Linux.

While a process has the FIFO open for writing, a reader will block waiting for input, even if the process is itself.
If a reader gets EOF (0 bytes read), it can close the FIFO and reopen it; the open() call will wait until a new writer opens the FIFO.
If there is no writer, the reader will hang in a busy loop continually reading no bytes, unless the code takes step to avoid it.

Notes
The code includes a random_milli_nap() function which takes a minimum and maximum nap time in milliseconds and waits for a random time in that interval.  It uses rand(); it would not be hard to upgrade it to use a separate PRNG (so as not to interfere with other random number sequences).
The code includes some semi-useful signal handling.  It uses stderr.c and stderr.h from src/libsoq because that simplifies error reporting.",True,{}

trie89.c
Identify which dictionary is used, and change the default to alt.words.01.


SO 4997-3664


trie-search13.c
Load one or more dictionaries of words, and then analyze word lists from files or from command line word arguments.  This has basic search functionality, recognizing concatenated sequences of known words from  the dictionaries that are loaded.


trie-split59.c
An extension of trie-search13.c which recognizes unknown words, and skips over that material to find more known words after the unknown. This uses the 'array of strings' code from aoscopy.[ch] in the libsoq directory.  This code does not manage to distinguish between words and non-words after the list is processed, but does handle spaces between words — so it can process README.md, unlike trie-search13.c.


trie-split67.c
An extension of trie-split67.c which records the classification of strings into non-alphabetic, known word and unknown word.  This uses the 'array of memory blocks' code from aommngd.[ch], which was developed to handle this use case.


alt.words.01 — a smallish set of words with common prefixes.


alt.words.02 — a larger set of words, with all initial letters of the alphabet present.


alt.words.03 — some concatenated numeric words.


alt.words.04 — words list for some of the more complex concatenated words found in the README.md file, etc.


alt.words.05 — adds 'a' and 'an' as words.


alt.words.06 — various complex concatenated words.


Running:
trie-split67 -d words.numeric -d alt.words.04 -d alt.words.05 -w alt.words.06
