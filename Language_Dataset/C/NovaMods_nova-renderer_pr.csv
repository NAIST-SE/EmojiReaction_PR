Another issue currently it builds most of the files twice since it builds the shared library, and the test executable. Ideally we would want to have the test just link against the shared library, but i havent quite figured out how to do this yet.
I'd also like to move the files in git that are within the build directory somewhere else, then do a cmake custom command to copy them into the build folder after the build is done. But i will need to consult with @DethRaid where he would want to put them.",True,{}

Pipeline create info doesn't specify the vertex fields. Instead, Nova uses shader reflection to ask the SPIR-V module what vertex fields it needs.

Some major changes I remember off the top of my head:

Renderpacks only supply the rendergraph for the 3D scene. The host application supplies the render graph for the UI. Nova itself has some tasks that run before the 3D scene or UI, and some tasks the run after the 3D scene and UI
Fixed up a lot of things in the Vulkan backend, such as semaphore creation
Nova uses shader reflection to get the vertex data layout for each pipeline. There's an assumption that the host application will provide mesh data in the correct format, but I don't have any validation for this assumption
Mesh data is now a void* to the vertex data and a void* to the index data. Nova no longer defines anything about the vertex format, so don't fuck up your vertices
Better C++ API for creating renderpasses and pipelines, which Nova uses to make the render pass to layer the UI on top of the 3D scene
RHI pipeline create info struct that's separate from the renderpack pipeline data struct. The RHI struct has all the data a pipeline needs, and some data that Nova doesn't use yet, while the renderpack struct is more user-friendly and a little higher level
Got minitrace working and added some minitrace events to a few places in the code. A future PR will add in more profiling
Lots of updates to rex::core as graphite developed new features and fixed bugs

Not sure about making CI happy, in theory the changes to the workflow included in this PR should make CI happy, but since the changes are not merged yet and GH always takes the workflow from master, we can't really test it. (It currently fails due to LFS)",True,{}

Previously, there was just one renderpass type. It was kinda cool I guess - but not cool enough
Now there's multiple types
SceneRenderpass is a renderpass over scene objects. It uses the bindless material system to access material parameters and textures, and it uses the standard pipeline system to render a bunch of meshes
GlobalRenderpass is a renderpass that operates ""globally"" - that is, it doesn't handle any objects in the scene. Intended use case is post-processing effects, or merging together the UI and scene output render targets. They use more bespoke code, typically using a RhiResourceBinder to bind resources to a pipeline
Of course, you can still create a renderpass that doesn't follow either of these paradigms. The UI renderpass is just that
What is a RhIResourceBinder? It's an abstraction for binding resources to pipelines. The Vulkan implementation performs shader reflection on a pipeline to extract the descriptor sets the pipelines uses, then creates VkDescriptorSetLayouts and a VkPipelineLayout to bind descriptor sets to that pipeline, and creates VkDescriptorSets to actually represent the resources to the GPU. You can change bound resources at any time, and the descriptor sets won't be updated until the next time you bind a RhiResourceBinder to a command list
I've also split the concept of a pipeline in two - surface pipelines and global pipelines. Surface pipelines draw objects in the scene using bindless materials, global pipelines are executed by a GlobalRenderpass over the whole scene. Currently all pipelines loaded from a renderpack are surface pipelines - a future PR will give renderpack pipelines a way to say if they're surface or global
That's the long and the short of it","I've done a refactor
