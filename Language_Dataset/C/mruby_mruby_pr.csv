Choice of hash code
I decided to go with the libsodium implementations of siphash and cryptographically secure bytes, because libsodium is very widely used, and the code is released under ISC, which is compatible with MIT.

This PR fixes the issue by applying a randomly seeded hash to object_id, resulting in object_ids being nondeterministic.

For review @fbogsany @matz","Does it really need to be hashed though? Generating a random seed stored in the mrb_value state and XORing it to an object pointer should be sufficient to avoid easy memory leak. At worst, it might allow an attacker to get hint about an object location relative to another, but should leave many ASLR bits unleakable. Faster and simpler implementation than hashing and no improbable, but possible collision on 32bits.
Class.new.to_s and Proc.new{}.to_s should also be addressed as they leak heap address as well.",True,{}

Let's use following program, build with 2 source files. One of them is C, the other one is C++. To be able to use each others functions, C++ functions are declared as extern ""C"".
This is of course a simplified version of mruby code, where (before this patch) most of the codebase was C, and exception-related parts were C++ with C linkage.
// cpp_code.cpp
#include <stdio.h>

extern ""C"" void c_func();

extern ""C"" void cpp_func()
{
	throw 1;
}

int main()
{
	try
	{
		c_func();
	}
	catch (int exception)
	{
		fprintf(stderr, ""Exception correctly caught: %d\n"", exception);
	}
}
// c_code.c
void cpp_func();

void c_func()
{
	cpp_func();
}
Let's build them like this:
clang++ ${FLAGS} -c cpp_code.cpp -o cpp_code.o
clang   ${FLAGS} -c c_code.c     -o c_code.o
clang++ ${FLAGS} c_code.o cpp_code.o -o test
./test

Now, everything depends on FLAGS. If we run this with empty FLAGS, the compiler will default to 64-bit mode, and the code will run correctly:
Exception correctly caught: 1

However, if we set FLAGS to -m32, forcing 32-bit mode, the result will be very different:
libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type int

The problem observable here is undefined behavior of C++ exceptions passing C code barrier. It may run correctly if the ABI supports is (which is the case under 64-bit OSX), but it doesn't need to (like 32-bit OSX) - and then the code will crash as soon as the exception crosses C/C++ barrier.
I am running these tests on OSX (10.12.2) with Apple LLVM version 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.42.1), but the same behavior is visible under other versions of Clang and also under Linux.",True,{}

mrb_str_new_lit makes nofree string.
And then, mrb_str_modify change from nofree to normal rstring in mrb_str_cat. But this rstring's malloced size is 1.
And then, memcpy append chars to rstring(It's already wrong)
And then, realloc clashed with this rstring ptr(I don't know why).

The ways of fix

No fix mrb_str_modify. And care it memory and rstring modes.
mrb_str_modify makes embed string(resize_capa supported embed rstring).

So, I choose 2.
Concern
Shared rstring also have this issue. But I couldn't error cases.","mruby master branch was failed

mrb_str_new_lit makes nofree string.
And then, mrb_str_modify change from nofree to normal rstring in mrb_str_cat. But this rstring's malloced size is 1.
And then, memcpy append chars to rstring(It's already wrong)
And then, realloc clashed with this rstring ptr(I don't know why).

The ways of fix

No fix mrb_str_modify. And care it memory and rstring modes.
mrb_str_modify makes embed string(resize_capa supported embed rstring).

So, I choose 2.

However, I actually use pretty much all of these flags in my personal build script, so if everyone's going to be using them because there's a clear benefit with zero draw-backs (and are completely necessary with cases like fix-cortex-a8) then I'm happy including them in the base toolchain script.
I am generally skeptical about making decisions on behalf of the end user, you can probably tell this from the TODO consideration at the top concerning selecting a default target architecture, so my original thinking was let the user define their switches.

The examples are nice and contribute to the promotion of MRuby being used on Android. You can probably tell I constructed the revised Android toolchain script from pulling apart and piecing together the old one, so I was not comfortable including my personal build scripts as examples. Your examples are far more simpler and clear than my personal scripts - perhaps moving compile flags into the base script has helped simplify things here.
I am hesitant about selecting platform 24 as a target in the examples, part of my goal with the revised base toolchain was to have the Android platform automatically select the latest installed via the ::platform method.
If I were to change anything it would be to comment out the :platform => 'android-24' so it is left there for the user to see it as a potential option in the example, or alternatively rename the example files to ""build_config_android_24_armeabi.rb"" and ""build_config_android_24_arm64-v8a.rb"" to describe that they will specifically target platform 24.",True,{}

You were worrying about double setup of mrbgem. Got it.
At the time when I wrote the minimum dependencies testing feature, it wasn't a mrbgem.
And I felt it shouldn't be a mrbgem like mruby compiler at that time.
Anyway I think at least dependencies solving shouldn't be done when setup method(and the block passed to gem spec) is evaluated.
Since dependencies won't be completed until all setup method of each mrbgems is evaluated.
So it should be moved to rake file of mruby build system or dependencies solving should be done in rake task that compiles mruby test code and generates C code.
(About this patch:)
I feel  setup method should only be called in tasks/mrbgems.rake to reduce call order complexity.
Instead of ignoring it, it should raise some error on double evaluation of it to check build script errors.",True,{}

EDIT: After testing, %1d does not specify the maximum digits output, only the minimum (is in effect equivalent to %d).
Reducing buf to 3 works fine, with the most significant number being used in the buffer, for single digit integers this will always be the units, I think this would be acceptable as long as the case tree < 10 && tree >= 0 is true.

The book helped a lot to start implementing this.
This PR isn't squashed since its modification is too big and may need more changes.

The parser is mostly ported from CRuby's parse.y. Thanks to CRuby developers.

Though AST generating is completely different since data structure of mruby AST is different from CRuby.


Most test from ruby/spec is passing.
Before Optimize keyword arguments., I've implemented handling keyword arguments only with Hash.

After adding OP_SENDK, it uses Array to handle passed keyword arguments instead. Though the old way is still used to handle arguments with OP_SEND or OP_SENDB opcode.
struct mrb_callinfo size is increased for optimization.
I've re-reduced size of mrb_callinfo by reducing size of acc field since it's always 9-bit integer(GETARG_A). Thanks to @miura1729 for some advice.
And kwds is removed since it's value is from kdict.


Some codedump.c improvements is added to know what is on the stack.

Name block, rest arguments, keyword rest arguments with &, *, ** when there is no specific variable name.
Print local variable names with VM code dumps.


This PR breaks VM compatibilities mostly in 4 opcodes(3 new and 1 changed).

OP_KARG and OP_KDICT's behavior is changed from the previous documentation to make keyword arguments handling easier. See updated documents for detail.
OP_SENDK is added to call method with optimized keyword arguments passing.

Instead of building hash, it creates array of keyword symbol and value pairs terminated with nil object.
In OP_KARG keyword is linear searched instead of mrb_hash_get.


OP_ENTER's arguments specifier's layout has changed. And now maybe it's got a big VM instruction.

In old layout there was no difference between required keyword and keyword with default argument.
Post required arguments is decreased to 4 bit(max: 31 -> 15).
Required keyword arguments and optional keyword arguments is 3 bit (max: 7) each.
After changing it I've noticed that adding another opcode like OP_ENTERK may make VM compatible.




Differences between CRuby:

Hash#fetch(implemented in mruby-hash-ext), Hash#delete, Hash#key? isn't used to handle keyword arguments. So Hash methods overwriting example in Ruby Under a Microscope can't be reproduced in this implementation.


mrb_get_args can only handle keyword arguments with last hash argument.

After adding OP_SENDK, it uses Array to handle passed keyword arguments instead. Though the old way is still used to handle arguments with OP_SEND or OP_SENDB opcode.
struct mrb_callinfo size is increased for optimization.
I've re-reduced size of mrb_callinfo by reducing size of acc field since it's always 9-bit integer(GETARG_A). Thanks to @miura1729 for some advice.
And kwds is removed since it's value is from kdict.


Some codedump.c improvements is added to know what is on the stack.

Name block, rest arguments, keyword rest arguments with &, *, ** when there is no specific variable name.
Print local variable names with VM code dumps.


This PR breaks VM compatibilities mostly in 4 opcodes(3 new and 1 changed).

OP_KARG and OP_KDICT's behavior is changed from the previous documentation to make keyword arguments handling easier. See updated documents for detail.
OP_SENDK is added to call method with optimized keyword arguments passing.

Instead of building hash, it creates array of keyword symbol and value pairs terminated with nil object.
In OP_KARG keyword is linear searched instead of mrb_hash_get.


OP_ENTER's arguments specifier's layout has changed. And now maybe it's got a big VM instruction.

In old layout there was no difference between required keyword and keyword with default argument.
Post required arguments is decreased to 4 bit(max: 31 -> 15).
Required keyword arguments and optional keyword arguments is 3 bit (max: 7) each.
After changing it I've noticed that adding another opcode like OP_ENTERK may make VM compatible.




Differences between CRuby:

Hash#fetch(implemented in mruby-hash-ext), Hash#delete, Hash#key? isn't used to handle keyword arguments. So Hash methods overwriting example in Ruby Under a Microscope can't be reproduced in this implementation.


mrb_get_args can only handle keyword arguments with last hash argument.

After changing it I've noticed that adding another opcode like OP_ENTERK may make VM compatible.




Differences between CRuby:

Hash#fetch(implemented in mruby-hash-ext), Hash#delete, Hash#key? isn't used to handle keyword arguments. So Hash methods overwriting example in Ruby Under a Microscope can't be reproduced in this implementation.


mrb_get_args can only handle keyword arguments with last hash argument.

This PR isn't squashed since its modification is too big and may need more changes.

The parser is mostly ported from CRuby's parse.y. Thanks to CRuby developers.

Though AST generating is completely different since data structure of mruby AST is different from CRuby.


Most test from ruby/spec is passing.
Before Optimize keyword arguments., I've implemented handling keyword arguments only with Hash.

After adding OP_SENDK, it uses Array to handle passed keyword arguments instead. Though the old way is still used to handle arguments with OP_SEND or OP_SENDB opcode.
struct mrb_callinfo size is increased for optimization.
I've re-reduced size of mrb_callinfo by reducing size of acc field since it's always 9-bit integer(GETARG_A). Thanks to @miura1729 for some advice.
And kwds is removed since it's value is from kdict.


Some codedump.c improvements is added to know what is on the stack.

Name block, rest arguments, keyword rest arguments with &, *, ** when there is no specific variable name.
Print local variable names with VM code dumps.


This PR breaks VM compatibilities mostly in 4 opcodes(3 new and 1 changed).

OP_KARG and OP_KDICT's behavior is changed from the previous documentation to make keyword arguments handling easier. See updated documents for detail.
OP_SENDK is added to call method with optimized keyword arguments passing.

Instead of building hash, it creates array of keyword symbol and value pairs terminated with nil object.
In OP_KARG keyword is linear searched instead of mrb_hash_get.


OP_ENTER's arguments specifier's layout has changed. And now maybe it's got a big VM instruction.

In old layout there was no difference between required keyword and keyword with default argument.

I marked this PR as Experimental to emphasize that it's the main purpose is to discuss the problem (or this is not a problem at all?).
The problem
Currently, Ruby files are loaded and compiled in lexicographical order. Thus we have to use such tricks as using file prefixes just to control this (even in mruby core). And that's an example from my lib (which inspired me to write this).
So, there is no way (other then naming hacks) to specify dependencies (usually we need it when using modules with shared logic).
The Idea
I was thinking of how to tell the builder to compile Ruby files in the specified order and came up with the following idea: let's use magic comments to declare dependencies:
# require: utils/logging

class Base
  include Utils::Logging
  ...
end
Looks like Sprockets 😏
Pros: easy to use/read, backward-compatible.
Cons: that differs from Ruby.
Other ideas
Another option I see is to specify the build order hints somewhere in config:
# Load specified files first, then everything else
conf.compile_first = %w(utils/**/*.rb zzz.rb)
Pros: no language changes.
Cons: harder to maintain (maybe, that's OK for mRuby libs, 'cause they're usually not too big).","Disclaimer
I marked this PR as Experimental to emphasize that it's the main purpose is to discuss the problem (or this is not a problem at all?).
The problem
Currently, Ruby files are loaded and compiled in lexicographical order. Thus we have to use such tricks as using file prefixes just to control this (even in mruby core). And that's an example from my lib (which inspired me to write this).
So, there is no way (other then naming hacks) to specify dependencies (usually we need it when using modules with shared logic).

This is caused by creating the underlying khash with the same size as the hash. On the other hand, the khash is always kept big enough to have at least 1/4 empty buckets (

). This resizes the khashes directly after creation when they are filled with items. To prevent this the khash is initialized with 4/3 the size of the hash.
The resulting times are shown in the ""After"" column below. They are smaller for hashes in said size ranges and grow more linear in general.

CRuby document says.
Array http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Array.html#method-i-compact

compact! → ary or nil
Removes nil elements from the array.
Returns nil if no changes were made, otherwise returns the array.

Hash http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Hash.html#method-i-compact

compact! → hsh
Removes all nil values from the hash. Returns the hash.

Hash document is not pointing to something like Returns nil if no changes were made, otherwise returns the hash....

In both cases the stack should have room for the block. Actually, the stack was just accessed at the block's offset a few lines earlier. Removing those lines does not break any tests.","Alright, I also investigated some more.
Like you said, because of #3504 the ci->nregs = bidx+1 was introduced in b64f087. This led to the follow up error #3551 whose fix introduced the if (bidx >= ci->nregs) check in 071164b and the stack_extend(mrb, ci->nregs) in 93d8029.
Then, the code causing #3504 reappeared again in #3590. The fix for it moved the code dealing with the block in OP_SUPER from below the cipush  to above the cipush (d9fb8b6). The if (bidx >= ci->nregs) { ... } from then on works with the original callinfo and not the pushed one. ci->nregs needed to be modified for the pushed one because it is initialized to 0. But for the original ci it is propertly set and a check is not needed.
It looks to me, that getting the block before cipush seems to be the proper fix for the issues. Checking out d9fb8b6 and removing the if (bidx >= ci->nregs) blocks does not crash with the code given in #3504, #3551 and #3590. master does not crash either.
I'm going to add a commit with the checks removed. Just leave it out if I missed something.",True,{}

Current mruby specific timegm() at mrbgems/mruby-time/src/time.c cannot returns minus value.
I tested with following Ruby code and result is following:
assert('Time.new with Dec 31 23:59:59 1969 raise ArgumentError') do
  assert_raise(ArgumentError) {Time.new(1969, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59)} # Passed

assert('Time.gm with Dec 31 23:59:59 1969 raise ArgumentError') do
  assert_raise(ArgumentError) {Time.gm(1969, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59)} # Failed
end

I still cannot understand why ArgumentError is raised at Dec 31 23:59:59 1969,
but if Time.gm is called with older than 1970, returns unix time ""31535999"" internally
and behave differently with Time.new.
I changed timegm() can returns minus value when older than 1970 is input with TIme.new and TIme.gm.

I'm not sure too which is good because I have no idea of memory restricted environments.

For what it's worth, I just took a simple profile.

puts ""# of hashes: %d"" % [(WIDTH ** (HEIGHT + 1) - 1) / (HEIGHT - 1)]

  return hash if depth == 0
  WIDTH.times {|i| hash[i] = gen(depth - 1) }

h = gen(HEIGHT)
recur = {} # protect from GC
str = PR ? h._inspect(recur) : h.inspect
puts ""recur.size: #{recur.size}""

Summary
Add built-in symbols embedded in object code at build time.
ビルド時にオブジェクトコードへと埋め込まれる組み込みシンボルを追加します。
Description


Allocate strings as built-in symbols and arrays of symbol structures (symbol_name) as static const at build time.
組み込みシンボルとしての文字列、及びシンボルの構造体 (symbol_name) の配列を static const としてビルド時に確保します。


Collect the character strings as symbols. At this time, small strings matching the end of the large string are merged.
シンボルとなる文字列をまとめます。このとき大きい文字列の末端に一致する小さい文字列は統合されます。
e.g.:

""Object"" is included in ""BasicObject""
""RUBY_VERSION"" is included in ""MRUBY_VERSION""
""cmp"" and ""p"" are included in ""__ary_cmp""



If you create multiple mrb_state, you can share embedded symbols.
複数の mrb_state を作成した場合、組み込みシンボルを共有することが出来ます。


The symbols other than the built-in symbols (I call it runtime symbols at will) are placed in the struct symbol_name allocated in the heap as before.
組み込みシンボル以外のシンボル (僕は勝手に実行時シンボルと呼んでいます) は、これまで通りヒープに確保された struct symbol_name に置かれます。


Although the .text + .rodata section increases by about 10 KB, measurement by valgrind mruby - e '' decreased malloc from 181.6 KB to 147.8 KB.
In mrbtest, malloc has decreased by about 1.8 MB.
.text + .rodata セクションが約 10 KB 増えますが、valgrind mruby -e '' による計測では malloc が 181.6 KB から 147.8 KB へと減少しました。
mrbtest においては、malloc が約 1.8 MB 減少しました。

Appended macros

MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX (in include/mruby/value.h) - default is zero
MRB_FORCE_INLINE (in include/mruby.h) (Provided by builtin-symbols-rev2 patch set) - default is same as MRB_INLINE

Appended files


include/mruby/id.h - as a part of public mruby API


src/builtin_symbols.h - string table for symbols, and array of struct symbol_name


outsym.rb (NOT INCLUDED YET) - export all symbols
$ host/bin/mruby outsym.rb > symbols.yaml



mksymtbl.rb (NOT INCLUDED YET) - generate include/mruby/id.h and src/builtin_symbols.h files, and modify MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX macro
$ ruby mksymtbl.rb < symbols.yaml



outsym.rb, mksymtbl.rb and symbols.yaml are currently in gist.

outsym.rb
mksymtbl.rb

How to implementation


It is expressed from the maximum value of mrb_sym (unsigned 32-bit integer value) using the necessary range for the number of built-in symbols.
mrb_sym (符号なし32ビット整数値) の最大値から組み込みシンボルの個数に必要な範囲を用いて表現しています。
/* from src/symbol.c */

#define MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_PIVOT (UINT32_MAX - MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX)
#define MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOL_P(sym) ((sym) > MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_PIVOT)


Considering it as the value of a built-in symbol, it refers to struct symbol_name builtin_symbols_table[] allocated as static const at the time of build.
組み込みシンボルの値とみなすと、ビルド時に static const として確保した struct symbol_name builtin_symbols_table[] を参照するようになります。


At this time, take a complement such as ~symbol, and make it an array subscript.
この時 ~symbol のように一の補数を取って、配列の添字とします。
mrb_sym symbol = ...;
const symbol_name *sname = &builtin_symbols_table[~symbol];


builtin_symbols_table is defined in src/builtin_symbols.h and #included from src/symbol.c.
builtin_symbols_table は src/builtin_symbols.h で定義され、src/symbol.c から #include されます。


mrb->symtbl will be initialized with mrb_init_symtbl() as a work area.
mrb->symtbl は作業領域として mrb_init_symtbl() で初期化されるようになります。


include/mruby/id.h, src/builtin_symbols.h, and include/mruby/value.h MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX constants are automatically generated and rewritten by mksymtbl.rb I will.
We created host/bin/mruby with a smaller configuration, and all the symbols are included in the built-in symbols.
include/mruby/id.h と src/builtin_symbols.h、および include/mruby/value.h の MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX 定数は、mksymtbl.rb によって自動生成・書き換えが行われます。
小さめの構成で host/bin/mruby を作成し、その全シンボルを組み込みシンボルの対象としています。
The configuration of host/bin/mruby is as follows:
MRuby::Build.new do |conf|
  toolchain :gcc
  conf.build_dir = ""host""
  enable_debug
  enable_test

  gem core: ""mruby-sprintf""
  gem core: ""mruby-print""
  gem core: ""mruby-symbol-ext""
  gem core: ""mruby-bin-mrbc""
  gem core: ""mruby-bin-mirb""
  gem core: ""mruby-bin-mruby""
end
================================================
      Config Name: host
 Output Directory: host
         Binaries: mrbc, mrbtest
    Included Gems:
             mruby-sprintf - standard Kernel#sprintf method
             mruby-print - standard print/puts/p
             mruby-symbol-ext - Symbol class extension
             mruby-compiler - mruby compiler library

               - Binaries: mruby
             mruby-test - mruby test
================================================

Execute outsym.rb with the created host/bin/mruby. By processing the result with mksymtbl.rb it is possible to generate include/mruby/id.h and src/builtin_symbols.h files and include/mruby/value.h MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX constant Rewrite.
作成した host/bin/mruby で outsym.rb を実行します。その結果を mksymtbl.rb で処理することで include/mruby/id.h と src/builtin_symbols.h のファイル生成、および include/mruby/value.h の MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX 定数を書き換えます。
$ build/host/bin/mruby outsym.rb > symbols.yaml
$ vim symbol.yaml  ## edit symbols if needed
$ ruby mksymtbl.rb < symbol.yaml

symbols.yaml is in gist at this time.


Problems & Issues for this patch


Built-in symbols are expressed from the maximum value using the range that becomes the number of built-in symbols required.
This reduces the available symbol space.
組み込みシンボルは最大値から必要とする組み込みシンボルの数となる範囲を用いて表現しています。
これにより利用可能なシンボル空間が減少しています。


At this stage, the total size of the literal character string is increased inversely in a state where the literal character string is doubly present.
To further promote, it is necessary to replace the definition of the method name or the like with the embedded symbol value.
現段階ではリテラル文字列が二重にあるような状態で、リテラル文字列の合計サイズを逆に増やすことになります。
さらに推し進める場合は、メソッド名などの定義を組み込みシンボル値に置き換える必要があります。
This result can be confirmed with the next patch set:


builtin-symbols-rev3
Replace mrb_intern_lit () contained in the src/* file with MRB_ID_XXX.
src/* のファイルに含まれる mrb_intern_lit() を MRB_ID_XXX に置き換えます。


builtin-symbols-rev4
In addition to builtin-symbols-rev3, replace mrb_define_method() with mrb_define_method_id() + MRB_ID_XXX.
If MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS is not defined, it leads to an increase in object code, and it is likely to be MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS.
builtin-symbols-rev3 に加えて、mrb_define_method() を mrb_define_method_id() + MRB_ID_XXX に置き換えます。
MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS が定義されない場合はオブジェクトコードを増加させることにつながり、MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS ありきとなりがちです。




Incorporating all the symbols generated by conf.gembox ""default"", we will occupy more ROM than necessary.
Also, since dynamically allocated khash tables for symbols grow larger, the effect of setting struct symbol_name [] to static const is lost.
It is necessary to pick up built-in symbols.
conf.gembox ""default"" で生成される全てのシンボルを組み込んだ場合、必要以上に ROM を専有することになります。
また、シンボルのための動的に確保される khash テーブルが大きくなるため、struct symbol_name[] を static const にした効果が失われます。
組み込みシンボルの収拾選択が必要です。

Comparison of @master/host-O, @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O and @builtin-symbols-rev3/host-O
These should eliminate the difference after the preprocessor and actually .text and .rodata are the same.
これらはプリプロセッサ後の差異が無くなるはずであり、実際に .text と .rodata は同じになっています。


Comparison of @master/host-O and @builtin-symbols-rev4/host-O
For example, since mrb_define_method() is decomposed into mrb_define_method_id() + mrb_intern_lit(), .text is incremented by the call to mrb_intern_lit().
Instead, malloc decreases slightly.
I think this tendency is similar to #4065.
例えば mrb_define_method() が mrb_define_method_id() + mrb_intern_lit() に分解されるため、mrb_intern_lit() の呼び出しの分だけ .text が増加します。
その代わり malloc が微減します。
この傾向は #4065 も似ていると思います。


Comparison of @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O and @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O+builtin-symbols
It is almost the same as the expected increase in .rodata size due to the incorporation of symbols.
組み込みシンボル化に伴う想定された .rodata サイズの増加とほぼ同じとなっています。
table size = 401 symbols * sizeof(symbol_name) = 6416 bytes (for 64 bit platform)
combined pool size = 2712 bytes (+ 342 NUL bytes) (Symbolic strings with NUL jointed)
total size = 6416 bytes + 2712 bytes + 342 NUL bytes = 9470 bytes

Since processing for built-in symbols is inserted, .text increases slightly.
組み込みシンボルのための処理が差し込まれるため、.text が微増しています。
malloc has decreased by nearly 34 KB. I think that it will be about 17 KB in 32 bit environment.
malloc が 34 KB 近く減少しています。32 ビット環境では 17 KB ほどになるかと思います。


Comparison of @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O+builtin-symbols and @builtin-symbols-rev3/host-O+builtin-symbols
Because mrb_intern_lit() in src is replaced with MRB_ID_XXX as an integer value, .text and .rodata are slightly decreasing.
src 中の mrb_intern_lit() が整数値としての MRB_ID_XXX に置き換わるため、.text と .rodata が微減しています。


Comparison of @builtin-symbols-rev3/host-O+builtin-symbols and @builtin-symbols-rev4/host-O+builtin-symbols
.rodata is subtracted slightly because the string given bymrb_define_method ()in src is replaced with MRB_ID_XXX as an integer value.
src 中の mrb_define_method() で与えていた文字列が整数値としての MRB_ID_XXX に置き換わるため、.rodata が微減しています。

Summary
Add built-in symbols embedded in object code at build time.
ビルド時にオブジェクトコードへと埋め込まれる組み込みシンボルを追加します。
Description


Allocate strings as built-in symbols and arrays of symbol structures (symbol_name) as static const at build time.
組み込みシンボルとしての文字列、及びシンボルの構造体 (symbol_name) の配列を static const としてビルド時に確保します。


Collect the character strings as symbols. At this time, small strings matching the end of the large string are merged.
シンボルとなる文字列をまとめます。このとき大きい文字列の末端に一致する小さい文字列は統合されます。
e.g.:

""Object"" is included in ""BasicObject""
""RUBY_VERSION"" is included in ""MRUBY_VERSION""
""cmp"" and ""p"" are included in ""__ary_cmp""



If you create multiple mrb_state, you can share embedded symbols.
複数の mrb_state を作成した場合、組み込みシンボルを共有することが出来ます。


The symbols other than the built-in symbols (I call it runtime symbols at will) are placed in the struct symbol_name allocated in the heap as before.
組み込みシンボル以外のシンボル (僕は勝手に実行時シンボルと呼んでいます) は、これまで通りヒープに確保された struct symbol_name に置かれます。


Although the .text + .rodata section increases by about 10 KB, measurement by valgrind mruby - e '' decreased malloc from 181.6 KB to 147.8 KB.

How to implementation


It is expressed from the maximum value of mrb_sym (unsigned 32-bit integer value) using the necessary range for the number of built-in symbols.
mrb_sym (符号なし32ビット整数値) の最大値から組み込みシンボルの個数に必要な範囲を用いて表現しています。
/* from src/symbol.c */

#define MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_PIVOT (UINT32_MAX - MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX)
#define MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOL_P(sym) ((sym) > MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_PIVOT)


Considering it as the value of a built-in symbol, it refers to struct symbol_name builtin_symbols_table[] allocated as static const at the time of build.
組み込みシンボルの値とみなすと、ビルド時に static const として確保した struct symbol_name builtin_symbols_table[] を参照するようになります。


At this time, take a complement such as ~symbol, and make it an array subscript.
この時 ~symbol のように一の補数を取って、配列の添字とします。
mrb_sym symbol = ...;
const symbol_name *sname = &builtin_symbols_table[~symbol];


builtin_symbols_table is defined in src/builtin_symbols.h and #included from src/symbol.c.
builtin_symbols_table は src/builtin_symbols.h で定義され、src/symbol.c から #include されます。


mrb->symtbl will be initialized with mrb_init_symtbl() as a work area.
mrb->symtbl は作業領域として mrb_init_symtbl() で初期化されるようになります。


include/mruby/id.h, src/builtin_symbols.h, and include/mruby/value.h MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX constants are automatically generated and rewritten by mksymtbl.rb I will.
We created host/bin/mruby with a smaller configuration, and all the symbols are included in the built-in symbols.
include/mruby/id.h と src/builtin_symbols.h、および include/mruby/value.h の MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX 定数は、mksymtbl.rb によって自動生成・書き換えが行われます。
小さめの構成で host/bin/mruby を作成し、その全シンボルを組み込みシンボルの対象としています。

Problems & Issues for this patch


Built-in symbols are expressed from the maximum value using the range that becomes the number of built-in symbols required.
This reduces the available symbol space.
組み込みシンボルは最大値から必要とする組み込みシンボルの数となる範囲を用いて表現しています。
これにより利用可能なシンボル空間が減少しています。


At this stage, the total size of the literal character string is increased inversely in a state where the literal character string is doubly present.
To further promote, it is necessary to replace the definition of the method name or the like with the embedded symbol value.
現段階ではリテラル文字列が二重にあるような状態で、リテラル文字列の合計サイズを逆に増やすことになります。
さらに推し進める場合は、メソッド名などの定義を組み込みシンボル値に置き換える必要があります。
This result can be confirmed with the next patch set:


builtin-symbols-rev3
Replace mrb_intern_lit () contained in the src/* file with MRB_ID_XXX.
src/* のファイルに含まれる mrb_intern_lit() を MRB_ID_XXX に置き換えます。


builtin-symbols-rev4
In addition to builtin-symbols-rev3, replace mrb_define_method() with mrb_define_method_id() + MRB_ID_XXX.
If MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS is not defined, it leads to an increase in object code, and it is likely to be MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS.
builtin-symbols-rev3 に加えて、mrb_define_method() を mrb_define_method_id() + MRB_ID_XXX に置き換えます。
MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS が定義されない場合はオブジェクトコードを増加させることにつながり、MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS ありきとなりがちです。




Incorporating all the symbols generated by conf.gembox ""default"", we will occupy more ROM than necessary.
Also, since dynamically allocated khash tables for symbols grow larger, the effect of setting struct symbol_name [] to static const is lost.
It is necessary to pick up built-in symbols.
conf.gembox ""default"" で生成される全てのシンボルを組み込んだ場合、必要以上に ROM を専有することになります。
また、シンボルのための動的に確保される khash テーブルが大きくなるため、struct symbol_name[] を static const にした効果が失われます。
組み込みシンボルの収拾選択が必要です。

Comparison of @master/host-O, @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O and @builtin-symbols-rev3/host-O
These should eliminate the difference after the preprocessor and actually .text and .rodata are the same.
これらはプリプロセッサ後の差異が無くなるはずであり、実際に .text と .rodata は同じになっています。


Comparison of @master/host-O and @builtin-symbols-rev4/host-O
For example, since mrb_define_method() is decomposed into mrb_define_method_id() + mrb_intern_lit(), .text is incremented by the call to mrb_intern_lit().
Instead, malloc decreases slightly.
I think this tendency is similar to #4065.
例えば mrb_define_method() が mrb_define_method_id() + mrb_intern_lit() に分解されるため、mrb_intern_lit() の呼び出しの分だけ .text が増加します。
その代わり malloc が微減します。
この傾向は #4065 も似ていると思います。


Comparison of @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O and @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O+builtin-symbols
It is almost the same as the expected increase in .rodata size due to the incorporation of symbols.
組み込みシンボル化に伴う想定された .rodata サイズの増加とほぼ同じとなっています。
table size = 401 symbols * sizeof(symbol_name) = 6416 bytes (for 64 bit platform)
combined pool size = 2712 bytes (+ 342 NUL bytes) (Symbolic strings with NUL jointed)
total size = 6416 bytes + 2712 bytes + 342 NUL bytes = 9470 bytes

Since processing for built-in symbols is inserted, .text increases slightly.
組み込みシンボルのための処理が差し込まれるため、.text が微増しています。
malloc has decreased by nearly 34 KB. I think that it will be about 17 KB in 32 bit environment.
malloc が 34 KB 近く減少しています。32 ビット環境では 17 KB ほどになるかと思います。


Comparison of @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O+builtin-symbols and @builtin-symbols-rev3/host-O+builtin-symbols
Because mrb_intern_lit() in src is replaced with MRB_ID_XXX as an integer value, .text and .rodata are slightly decreasing.
src 中の mrb_intern_lit() が整数値としての MRB_ID_XXX に置き換わるため、.text と .rodata が微減しています。


Comparison of @builtin-symbols-rev3/host-O+builtin-symbols and @builtin-symbols-rev4/host-O+builtin-symbols
.rodata is subtracted slightly because the string given bymrb_define_method ()in src is replaced with MRB_ID_XXX as an integer value.
src 中の mrb_define_method() で与えていた文字列が整数値としての MRB_ID_XXX に置き換わるため、.rodata が微減しています。

Questions


Which directory should you add outsym.rb and mksymtbl.rb, symbol.yaml, or does not it need it?
Also, please point out if there are parts that will be inconvenient when adding.
outsym.rb と mksymtbl.rb、symbol.yaml はどのディレクトリに追加するべきでしょうか? それとも不要ですか?
また、追加する時に不都合となる部分があればご指摘下さい。


Please give us your opinion if there are more favorable names of MRB_ID_XXX.
MRB_ID_XXX の名前についてより好ましいものがあればご意見下さい。


The branch this time as a pull request is builtin-symbols-rev1. Should it be better to proceed from the following builtin-symbols-rev2 to builtin-symbols-rev4?
今回プルリクエストとしたブランチは builtin-symbols-rev1 に当たります。この後に続く builtin-symbols-rev2 から builtin-symbols-rev4 までのどれかに進めたほうがよろしいでしょうか?


builtin-symbols-rev1 - The first stage of this pull request (このプルリクエストの最初の段階)


builtin-symbols-rev2 - Make sym_hash_equal() forced inline in MRB_ENABLE_FORCE_INLINE (MRB_ENABLE_FORCE_INLINE の場合に sym_hash_equal() を強制インライン化させる)


builtin-symbols-rev3 - Replaced mrb_intern_lit() below with MRB_ID_XXX below src (personally recommended) (src 以下の mrb_intern_lit() を MRB_ID_XXX に置き換えたもの (個人的におすすめ))


builtin-symbols-rev4 - Since mrb_define_method() etc. are decomposed into mrb_define_method_id() + MRB_ID_XXX, MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS is often used (mrb_define_method() などを分解して mrb_define_method_id() + MRB_ID_XXX のようにするため、MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS ありきとなりがち)

Summary
Add built-in symbols embedded in object code at build time.
ビルド時にオブジェクトコードへと埋め込まれる組み込みシンボルを追加します。
Description


Allocate strings as built-in symbols and arrays of symbol structures (symbol_name) as static const at build time.
組み込みシンボルとしての文字列、及びシンボルの構造体 (symbol_name) の配列を static const としてビルド時に確保します。


Collect the character strings as symbols. At this time, small strings matching the end of the large string are merged.
シンボルとなる文字列をまとめます。このとき大きい文字列の末端に一致する小さい文字列は統合されます。
e.g.:

""Object"" is included in ""BasicObject""
""RUBY_VERSION"" is included in ""MRUBY_VERSION""
""cmp"" and ""p"" are included in ""__ary_cmp""



If you create multiple mrb_state, you can share embedded symbols.
複数の mrb_state を作成した場合、組み込みシンボルを共有することが出来ます。


The symbols other than the built-in symbols (I call it runtime symbols at will) are placed in the struct symbol_name allocated in the heap as before.
組み込みシンボル以外のシンボル (僕は勝手に実行時シンボルと呼んでいます) は、これまで通りヒープに確保された struct symbol_name に置かれます。


Although the .text + .rodata section increases by about 10 KB, measurement by valgrind mruby - e '' decreased malloc from 181.6 KB to 147.8 KB.
In mrbtest, malloc has decreased by about 1.8 MB.

How to implementation


It is expressed from the maximum value of mrb_sym (unsigned 32-bit integer value) using the necessary range for the number of built-in symbols.
mrb_sym (符号なし32ビット整数値) の最大値から組み込みシンボルの個数に必要な範囲を用いて表現しています。
/* from src/symbol.c */

#define MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_PIVOT (UINT32_MAX - MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX)
#define MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOL_P(sym) ((sym) > MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_PIVOT)


Considering it as the value of a built-in symbol, it refers to struct symbol_name builtin_symbols_table[] allocated as static const at the time of build.
組み込みシンボルの値とみなすと、ビルド時に static const として確保した struct symbol_name builtin_symbols_table[] を参照するようになります。


At this time, take a complement such as ~symbol, and make it an array subscript.
この時 ~symbol のように一の補数を取って、配列の添字とします。
mrb_sym symbol = ...;
const symbol_name *sname = &builtin_symbols_table[~symbol];


builtin_symbols_table is defined in src/builtin_symbols.h and #included from src/symbol.c.
builtin_symbols_table は src/builtin_symbols.h で定義され、src/symbol.c から #include されます。


mrb->symtbl will be initialized with mrb_init_symtbl() as a work area.
mrb->symtbl は作業領域として mrb_init_symtbl() で初期化されるようになります。


include/mruby/id.h, src/builtin_symbols.h, and include/mruby/value.h MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX constants are automatically generated and rewritten by mksymtbl.rb I will.
We created host/bin/mruby with a smaller configuration, and all the symbols are included in the built-in symbols.
include/mruby/id.h と src/builtin_symbols.h、および include/mruby/value.h の MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX 定数は、mksymtbl.rb によって自動生成・書き換えが行われます。
小さめの構成で host/bin/mruby を作成し、その全シンボルを組み込みシンボルの対象としています。
The configuration of host/bin/mruby is as follows:
MRuby::Build.new do |conf|
  toolchain :gcc
  conf.build_dir = ""host""
  enable_debug
  enable_test

  gem core: ""mruby-sprintf""
  gem core: ""mruby-print""
  gem core: ""mruby-symbol-ext""
  gem core: ""mruby-bin-mrbc""
  gem core: ""mruby-bin-mirb""
  gem core: ""mruby-bin-mruby""
end
================================================
      Config Name: host
 Output Directory: host
         Binaries: mrbc, mrbtest
    Included Gems:
             mruby-sprintf - standard Kernel#sprintf method
             mruby-print - standard print/puts/p
             mruby-symbol-ext - Symbol class extension

             mruby-test - mruby test
================================================

Execute outsym.rb with the created host/bin/mruby. By processing the result with mksymtbl.rb it is possible to generate include/mruby/id.h and src/builtin_symbols.h files and include/mruby/value.h MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX constant Rewrite.
作成した host/bin/mruby で outsym.rb を実行します。その結果を mksymtbl.rb で処理することで include/mruby/id.h と src/builtin_symbols.h のファイル生成、および include/mruby/value.h の MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX 定数を書き換えます。
$ build/host/bin/mruby outsym.rb > symbols.yaml
$ vim symbol.yaml  ## edit symbols if needed
$ ruby mksymtbl.rb < symbol.yaml

symbols.yaml is in gist at this time.


Problems & Issues for this patch


Built-in symbols are expressed from the maximum value using the range that becomes the number of built-in symbols required.
This reduces the available symbol space.
組み込みシンボルは最大値から必要とする組み込みシンボルの数となる範囲を用いて表現しています。
これにより利用可能なシンボル空間が減少しています。


At this stage, the total size of the literal character string is increased inversely in a state where the literal character string is doubly present.
To further promote, it is necessary to replace the definition of the method name or the like with the embedded symbol value.
現段階ではリテラル文字列が二重にあるような状態で、リテラル文字列の合計サイズを逆に増やすことになります。
さらに推し進める場合は、メソッド名などの定義を組み込みシンボル値に置き換える必要があります。
This result can be confirmed with the next patch set:


builtin-symbols-rev3
Replace mrb_intern_lit () contained in the src/* file with MRB_ID_XXX.
src/* のファイルに含まれる mrb_intern_lit() を MRB_ID_XXX に置き換えます。


builtin-symbols-rev4
In addition to builtin-symbols-rev3, replace mrb_define_method() with mrb_define_method_id() + MRB_ID_XXX.
If MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS is not defined, it leads to an increase in object code, and it is likely to be MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS.
builtin-symbols-rev3 に加えて、mrb_define_method() を mrb_define_method_id() + MRB_ID_XXX に置き換えます。
MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS が定義されない場合はオブジェクトコードを増加させることにつながり、MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS ありきとなりがちです。




Incorporating all the symbols generated by conf.gembox ""default"", we will occupy more ROM than necessary.
Also, since dynamically allocated khash tables for symbols grow larger, the effect of setting struct symbol_name [] to static const is lost.
It is necessary to pick up built-in symbols.
conf.gembox ""default"" で生成される全てのシンボルを組み込んだ場合、必要以上に ROM を専有することになります。
また、シンボルのための動的に確保される khash テーブルが大きくなるため、struct symbol_name[] を static const にした効果が失われます。
組み込みシンボルの収拾選択が必要です。

Comparison of @master/host-O, @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O and @builtin-symbols-rev3/host-O
These should eliminate the difference after the preprocessor and actually .text and .rodata are the same.
これらはプリプロセッサ後の差異が無くなるはずであり、実際に .text と .rodata は同じになっています。


Comparison of @master/host-O and @builtin-symbols-rev4/host-O
For example, since mrb_define_method() is decomposed into mrb_define_method_id() + mrb_intern_lit(), .text is incremented by the call to mrb_intern_lit().
Instead, malloc decreases slightly.
I think this tendency is similar to #4065.
例えば mrb_define_method() が mrb_define_method_id() + mrb_intern_lit() に分解されるため、mrb_intern_lit() の呼び出しの分だけ .text が増加します。
その代わり malloc が微減します。
この傾向は #4065 も似ていると思います。


Comparison of @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O and @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O+builtin-symbols
It is almost the same as the expected increase in .rodata size due to the incorporation of symbols.
組み込みシンボル化に伴う想定された .rodata サイズの増加とほぼ同じとなっています。
table size = 401 symbols * sizeof(symbol_name) = 6416 bytes (for 64 bit platform)
combined pool size = 2712 bytes (+ 342 NUL bytes) (Symbolic strings with NUL jointed)
total size = 6416 bytes + 2712 bytes + 342 NUL bytes = 9470 bytes

Since processing for built-in symbols is inserted, .text increases slightly.
組み込みシンボルのための処理が差し込まれるため、.text が微増しています。
malloc has decreased by nearly 34 KB. I think that it will be about 17 KB in 32 bit environment.
malloc が 34 KB 近く減少しています。32 ビット環境では 17 KB ほどになるかと思います。


Comparison of @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O+builtin-symbols and @builtin-symbols-rev3/host-O+builtin-symbols
Because mrb_intern_lit() in src is replaced with MRB_ID_XXX as an integer value, .text and .rodata are slightly decreasing.
src 中の mrb_intern_lit() が整数値としての MRB_ID_XXX に置き換わるため、.text と .rodata が微減しています。


Comparison of @builtin-symbols-rev3/host-O+builtin-symbols and @builtin-symbols-rev4/host-O+builtin-symbols
.rodata is subtracted slightly because the string given bymrb_define_method ()in src is replaced with MRB_ID_XXX as an integer value.
src 中の mrb_define_method() で与えていた文字列が整数値としての MRB_ID_XXX に置き換わるため、.rodata が微減しています。

Questions


Which directory should you add outsym.rb and mksymtbl.rb, symbol.yaml, or does not it need it?
Also, please point out if there are parts that will be inconvenient when adding.
outsym.rb と mksymtbl.rb、symbol.yaml はどのディレクトリに追加するべきでしょうか? それとも不要ですか?
また、追加する時に不都合となる部分があればご指摘下さい。


Please give us your opinion if there are more favorable names of MRB_ID_XXX.
MRB_ID_XXX の名前についてより好ましいものがあればご意見下さい。


The branch this time as a pull request is builtin-symbols-rev1. Should it be better to proceed from the following builtin-symbols-rev2 to builtin-symbols-rev4?
今回プルリクエストとしたブランチは builtin-symbols-rev1 に当たります。この後に続く builtin-symbols-rev2 から builtin-symbols-rev4 までのどれかに進めたほうがよろしいでしょうか?

builtin-symbols-rev2 - Make sym_hash_equal() forced inline in MRB_ENABLE_FORCE_INLINE (MRB_ENABLE_FORCE_INLINE の場合に sym_hash_equal() を強制インライン化させる)


builtin-symbols-rev3 - Replaced mrb_intern_lit() below with MRB_ID_XXX below src (personally recommended) (src 以下の mrb_intern_lit() を MRB_ID_XXX に置き換えたもの (個人的におすすめ))


builtin-symbols-rev4 - Since mrb_define_method() etc. are decomposed into mrb_define_method_id() + MRB_ID_XXX, MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS is often used (mrb_define_method() などを分解して mrb_define_method_id() + MRB_ID_XXX のようにするため、MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS ありきとなりがち)

Summary
Add built-in symbols embedded in object code at build time.
ビルド時にオブジェクトコードへと埋め込まれる組み込みシンボルを追加します。
Description


Allocate strings as built-in symbols and arrays of symbol structures (symbol_name) as static const at build time.
組み込みシンボルとしての文字列、及びシンボルの構造体 (symbol_name) の配列を static const としてビルド時に確保します。


Collect the character strings as symbols. At this time, small strings matching the end of the large string are merged.
シンボルとなる文字列をまとめます。このとき大きい文字列の末端に一致する小さい文字列は統合されます。
e.g.:

""Object"" is included in ""BasicObject""
""RUBY_VERSION"" is included in ""MRUBY_VERSION""
""cmp"" and ""p"" are included in ""__ary_cmp""



If you create multiple mrb_state, you can share embedded symbols.
複数の mrb_state を作成した場合、組み込みシンボルを共有することが出来ます。


The symbols other than the built-in symbols (I call it runtime symbols at will) are placed in the struct symbol_name allocated in the heap as before.
組み込みシンボル以外のシンボル (僕は勝手に実行時シンボルと呼んでいます) は、これまで通りヒープに確保された struct symbol_name に置かれます。


Although the .text + .rodata section increases by about 10 KB, measurement by valgrind mruby - e '' decreased malloc from 181.6 KB to 147.8 KB.
In mrbtest, malloc has decreased by about 1.8 MB.
.text + .rodata セクションが約 10 KB 増えますが、valgrind mruby -e '' による計測では malloc が 181.6 KB から 147.8 KB へと減少しました。

How to implementation


It is expressed from the maximum value of mrb_sym (unsigned 32-bit integer value) using the necessary range for the number of built-in symbols.
mrb_sym (符号なし32ビット整数値) の最大値から組み込みシンボルの個数に必要な範囲を用いて表現しています。
/* from src/symbol.c */

#define MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_PIVOT (UINT32_MAX - MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX)
#define MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOL_P(sym) ((sym) > MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_PIVOT)


Considering it as the value of a built-in symbol, it refers to struct symbol_name builtin_symbols_table[] allocated as static const at the time of build.
組み込みシンボルの値とみなすと、ビルド時に static const として確保した struct symbol_name builtin_symbols_table[] を参照するようになります。


At this time, take a complement such as ~symbol, and make it an array subscript.
この時 ~symbol のように一の補数を取って、配列の添字とします。
mrb_sym symbol = ...;
const symbol_name *sname = &builtin_symbols_table[~symbol];


builtin_symbols_table is defined in src/builtin_symbols.h and #included from src/symbol.c.
builtin_symbols_table は src/builtin_symbols.h で定義され、src/symbol.c から #include されます。


mrb->symtbl will be initialized with mrb_init_symtbl() as a work area.
mrb->symtbl は作業領域として mrb_init_symtbl() で初期化されるようになります。


include/mruby/id.h, src/builtin_symbols.h, and include/mruby/value.h MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX constants are automatically generated and rewritten by mksymtbl.rb I will.
We created host/bin/mruby with a smaller configuration, and all the symbols are included in the built-in symbols.
include/mruby/id.h と src/builtin_symbols.h、および include/mruby/value.h の MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX 定数は、mksymtbl.rb によって自動生成・書き換えが行われます。
小さめの構成で host/bin/mruby を作成し、その全シンボルを組み込みシンボルの対象としています。
The configuration of host/bin/mruby is as follows:
MRuby::Build.new do |conf|
  toolchain :gcc
  conf.build_dir = ""host""
  enable_debug
  enable_test

  gem core: ""mruby-sprintf""
  gem core: ""mruby-print""
  gem core: ""mruby-symbol-ext""
  gem core: ""mruby-bin-mrbc""
  gem core: ""mruby-bin-mirb""
  gem core: ""mruby-bin-mruby""
end
================================================
      Config Name: host
 Output Directory: host
         Binaries: mrbc, mrbtest
    Included Gems:
             mruby-sprintf - standard Kernel#sprintf method
             mruby-print - standard print/puts/p
             mruby-symbol-ext - Symbol class extension

               - Binaries: mruby
             mruby-test - mruby test
================================================

Execute outsym.rb with the created host/bin/mruby. By processing the result with mksymtbl.rb it is possible to generate include/mruby/id.h and src/builtin_symbols.h files and include/mruby/value.h MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX constant Rewrite.
作成した host/bin/mruby で outsym.rb を実行します。その結果を mksymtbl.rb で処理することで include/mruby/id.h と src/builtin_symbols.h のファイル生成、および include/mruby/value.h の MRB_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS_MAX 定数を書き換えます。
$ build/host/bin/mruby outsym.rb > symbols.yaml
$ vim symbol.yaml  ## edit symbols if needed
$ ruby mksymtbl.rb < symbol.yaml

symbols.yaml is in gist at this time.


Problems & Issues for this patch


Built-in symbols are expressed from the maximum value using the range that becomes the number of built-in symbols required.
This reduces the available symbol space.
組み込みシンボルは最大値から必要とする組み込みシンボルの数となる範囲を用いて表現しています。
これにより利用可能なシンボル空間が減少しています。


At this stage, the total size of the literal character string is increased inversely in a state where the literal character string is doubly present.
To further promote, it is necessary to replace the definition of the method name or the like with the embedded symbol value.
現段階ではリテラル文字列が二重にあるような状態で、リテラル文字列の合計サイズを逆に増やすことになります。
さらに推し進める場合は、メソッド名などの定義を組み込みシンボル値に置き換える必要があります。
This result can be confirmed with the next patch set:


builtin-symbols-rev3
Replace mrb_intern_lit () contained in the src/* file with MRB_ID_XXX.
src/* のファイルに含まれる mrb_intern_lit() を MRB_ID_XXX に置き換えます。


builtin-symbols-rev4
In addition to builtin-symbols-rev3, replace mrb_define_method() with mrb_define_method_id() + MRB_ID_XXX.
If MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS is not defined, it leads to an increase in object code, and it is likely to be MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS.
builtin-symbols-rev3 に加えて、mrb_define_method() を mrb_define_method_id() + MRB_ID_XXX に置き換えます。
MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS が定義されない場合はオブジェクトコードを増加させることにつながり、MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS ありきとなりがちです。




Incorporating all the symbols generated by conf.gembox ""default"", we will occupy more ROM than necessary.
Also, since dynamically allocated khash tables for symbols grow larger, the effect of setting struct symbol_name [] to static const is lost.
It is necessary to pick up built-in symbols.
conf.gembox ""default"" で生成される全てのシンボルを組み込んだ場合、必要以上に ROM を専有することになります。
また、シンボルのための動的に確保される khash テーブルが大きくなるため、struct symbol_name[] を static const にした効果が失われます。
組み込みシンボルの収拾選択が必要です。

今回プルリクエストとしたパッチセットである builtin-symbols は -rev1 と同じであり、-rev2、-rev3、-rev4 と続きます。パッチセットについては Questions を参照して下さい。
MRB_ENABLE_FORCE_INLINE is undefined -rev2 is the same as -rev1, replace it with the value of -rev1.
MRB_ENABLE_FORCE_INLINE が未定義である -rev2 は -rev1 と同じであるため、-rev1 の値と読み替えて下さい。

Comparison of @master/host-O, @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O and @builtin-symbols-rev3/host-O
These should eliminate the difference after the preprocessor and actually .text and .rodata are the same.
これらはプリプロセッサ後の差異が無くなるはずであり、実際に .text と .rodata は同じになっています。


Comparison of @master/host-O and @builtin-symbols-rev4/host-O
For example, since mrb_define_method() is decomposed into mrb_define_method_id() + mrb_intern_lit(), .text is incremented by the call to mrb_intern_lit().
Instead, malloc decreases slightly.
I think this tendency is similar to #4065.
例えば mrb_define_method() が mrb_define_method_id() + mrb_intern_lit() に分解されるため、mrb_intern_lit() の呼び出しの分だけ .text が増加します。
その代わり malloc が微減します。
この傾向は #4065 も似ていると思います。


Comparison of @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O and @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O+builtin-symbols
It is almost the same as the expected increase in .rodata size due to the incorporation of symbols.
組み込みシンボル化に伴う想定された .rodata サイズの増加とほぼ同じとなっています。
table size = 401 symbols * sizeof(symbol_name) = 6416 bytes (for 64 bit platform)
combined pool size = 2712 bytes (+ 342 NUL bytes) (Symbolic strings with NUL jointed)
total size = 6416 bytes + 2712 bytes + 342 NUL bytes = 9470 bytes

Since processing for built-in symbols is inserted, .text increases slightly.
組み込みシンボルのための処理が差し込まれるため、.text が微増しています。
malloc has decreased by nearly 34 KB. I think that it will be about 17 KB in 32 bit environment.
malloc が 34 KB 近く減少しています。32 ビット環境では 17 KB ほどになるかと思います。


Comparison of @builtin-symbols-rev2/host-O+builtin-symbols and @builtin-symbols-rev3/host-O+builtin-symbols
Because mrb_intern_lit() in src is replaced with MRB_ID_XXX as an integer value, .text and .rodata are slightly decreasing.
src 中の mrb_intern_lit() が整数値としての MRB_ID_XXX に置き換わるため、.text と .rodata が微減しています。


Comparison of @builtin-symbols-rev3/host-O+builtin-symbols and @builtin-symbols-rev4/host-O+builtin-symbols
.rodata is subtracted slightly because the string given bymrb_define_method ()in src is replaced with MRB_ID_XXX as an integer value.
src 中の mrb_define_method() で与えていた文字列が整数値としての MRB_ID_XXX に置き換わるため、.rodata が微減しています。

Questions


Which directory should you add outsym.rb and mksymtbl.rb, symbol.yaml, or does not it need it?
Also, please point out if there are parts that will be inconvenient when adding.
outsym.rb と mksymtbl.rb、symbol.yaml はどのディレクトリに追加するべきでしょうか? それとも不要ですか?
また、追加する時に不都合となる部分があればご指摘下さい。


Please give us your opinion if there are more favorable names of MRB_ID_XXX.
MRB_ID_XXX の名前についてより好ましいものがあればご意見下さい。


The branch this time as a pull request is builtin-symbols-rev1. Should it be better to proceed from the following builtin-symbols-rev2 to builtin-symbols-rev4?
今回プルリクエストとしたブランチは builtin-symbols-rev1 に当たります。この後に続く builtin-symbols-rev2 から builtin-symbols-rev4 までのどれかに進めたほうがよろしいでしょうか?


builtin-symbols-rev1 - The first stage of this pull request (このプルリクエストの最初の段階)


builtin-symbols-rev2 - Make sym_hash_equal() forced inline in MRB_ENABLE_FORCE_INLINE (MRB_ENABLE_FORCE_INLINE の場合に sym_hash_equal() を強制インライン化させる)


builtin-symbols-rev3 - Replaced mrb_intern_lit() below with MRB_ID_XXX below src (personally recommended) (src 以下の mrb_intern_lit() を MRB_ID_XXX に置き換えたもの (個人的におすすめ))


builtin-symbols-rev4 - Since mrb_define_method() etc. are decomposed into mrb_define_method_id() + MRB_ID_XXX, MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS is often used (mrb_define_method() などを分解して mrb_define_method_id() + MRB_ID_XXX のようにするため、MRB_ENABLE_BUILTIN_SYMBOLS ありきとなりがち)

const char *presym_sym2name(uint32_t sym); returns pointer to symbol name from symbol number.

These functions are defined in src/presym.c, that is generaged by gperf.
Rake tasks
We add Rake tasks to update src/presym.c.

rake presym:build scan src/*.c and mrblib/*.rb, and update src/presym.c

presym:build execute 3 sub tasks. This task geneartes src/presym.json as imidiate list of symbols.
You can edit presym.json to add other symbols you may use.

rake presym:gen_json find symbols in src/*.c and mrblib/*.rb, and generate JSON file.
rake presym:gen_key load JSON file and generate presym.key for gperf.
rake presym:gen_c generate presym.c from presym.key with gperf.

This patch generates perfect hash function with gperf instead of khash.
With the patch, pre-defined symbols are in ROM area, not in khash struct in RAM, so mruby consume less RAM memory in execution time for embedded environments.
Usage
Define macro USE_PRESYM in build_config.rb.
  conf.cc.defines = %w(USE_PRESYM)
Without USE_PRESYM, nothing changed.
struct and functions
The patch add a struct and two functions in include/mruby/presym.h.

struct name2presym for name and symbol number pairs.
const struct name2presym *presym_find(const char *, unsigned int); returns name2presym from name and its length.

I'm not quite sure about that, because none of the exposed structs are start with mrb_. The common used names are things like RType, and the previous implementation exposes all methods start with khash_.

According to OpenBSD, FreeBSD and Linux online manuals, you must have to pass the value of unsigned char or EOF.

https://man.openbsd.org/isalpha#CAVEATS
https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=isalpha#DESCRIPTION
https://linuxjm.osdn.jp/html/LDP_man-pages/man3/isalpha.3.html#lbAD

Also, the implementation of newlib used by ESP-IDF is stated to intentionally trigger a warning.
https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/v3.1.3/components/newlib/include/ctype.h#L48-L56
The implementation of ctype of newlib may be found at https://github.com/eblot/newlib/blob/master/newlib/libc/ctype/ctype_.c (I do not know if it matches).

However, combining the above CONFIG_STACK_CHECK_NORM with -Wno-error=char-subscripts worked with release builds without applying this patch.

test/assert.rb is running on both CRuby (for bintest) and mruby (for mrbtest). mrbgems/mruby-test/driver.c is only used on mruby.


Therefore t_print is originally supported CRuby (it rescued __t_printstr__) and branch is needed. I don't have strong opinion about branching method, though using RUBY_ENGINE is lighter than rescue, respond_to? etc, I think.


In assert_match, I can probably remove branch if I reimplement _str_match? by Ruby code. But I'm reluctant to do it because regular expression (or File.fnmatch) is available in CRuby.",True,{}

It becomes effective by adding MRB_USE_CUSTOM_RO_DATA_P to conf.cc.defines in build_config.rb.
(Limitation) It can not be defined as an inline function.
Background
Defining MRB_USE_ETEXT_EDATA in ESP32 will increase RAM usage (the cause will be described later).
So, if we could use the user-definable mrb_ro_data_p () function, we could reduce it by 3.6 KiB.

Why define MRB_USE_ETEXT_EDATA causes more RAM usage on ESP32
Addresses indicated by _etext and __init_array_start on ESP32 are not in the expected layout of the mrb_ro_data_p() function.
Therefore, mrb_ro_data_p() is always FALSE, and it seems that irep is now allocated in the heap.

In 32-bit mode kernel space, 32-bit integers are insufficient (in personal terms, I'm glad if I can handle unsigned integer with more than 64 bits...).
If you define MRB_WITHOUT_FLOAT, the restriction is more strong.


gembox ""full-core"" succeeds even if mrb_int type included in struct RArray or struct RString is replaced with intptr_t (currently mruby-complex and mruby-rational requires modification).

Then, as you say, mrb_int size will be allowed to exceed pointer size and type for sizes such as string length it may be better to limit to pointer size (introduce a new type, e.g. mrb_size, which is an alias for intptr_t or uintptr_t?).

I think that it is better to leave the definition of mrb_int as it is from the viewpoint of the compatibility so far.

I checked what kind of transition the type of the len field of struct RString has followed:

Initially it was size_t:
https://github.com/mruby/mruby/blame/2fc1b8af2db70e2e008cecb9fd2d8600034f95f9/include/mruby/string.h#L29
It became long:
2970b6a#diff-d1ee00f2602251e1778ccf96047654c7L29
It became int:
f4cf8ea#diff-d1ee00f2602251e1778ccf96047654c7L29
It has now become the current mrb_int:
7e910bd#diff-d1ee00f2602251e1778ccf96047654c7L32
Release mruby-1.0.0.


Other object structures that exceed 6 words in 32-bit mode are struct RBreak defined in include/mruby/error.h.

Subject: [PATCH] Support parsing a Regexp literal with CRuby options

CRuby supports a 's' `Regexp` option for `Regexp` literals, e.g. `/foo/s`
that alters the encoding in the same way as the 'u' option. This commit
adds support for parsing such literals and sets Regexp options
appropriately.

CRuby supports a 'e' `Regexp` option for `Regexp` literals, e.g. `/foo/w`
that alters the encoding in the same way as the 'u' option. This commit
adds support for parsing such literals and sets Regexp options
appropriately.

CRuby supports a 'o' `Regexp` option for `Regexp` literals, e.g. `/foo/o`
that disables multiple interpolation passes. This commit adds support for
parsing such literals. Nothing is done with the option, it is consumed
and ignored by the parser.

As a premise, I am imagined that policy of mruby is to handle binary data and strings without distinction.
Therefore, I think that even if there are mixed characters that are invalid as UTF-8, they need to be handled without problems.
I also want to hear other people's opinions about this.

The character count of broken UTF-8 strings is different (This is similar to what @shuujii showed):

% ruby26 -e 'str = ""\xf1"" * 5; p str.encoding, str.size'

Crash when reversing a broken string as UTF-8:
% ./build/host/bin/mruby -e 'p (""\xf1"" * 5).reverse'
zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./mruby@test-utf8 -e 'p (""\xf1"" * 5).reverse'


If missing trailing characters, it will make an out-of-range reference:

More two comments:

It may not be good to treat Float (non Integer) the same as CRuby because mruby treats integers and float numbers more uniformly than CRuby (e.g. mruby has Float#succ). However I'm not sure how to fix it concretely right now.
The tests added to mruby-string-ext are not tests for Range#(max|min) but tests for Enumerable#(max|min) because mruby-string-ext doesn't depend on mruby-range-ext. I think it is undesirable mruby-string-ext depends on mruby-range-ext or tests for Range#(max|mix) exist in mruby-string-ext. Therefor, I think it is better to define and use String-like (has #succ) class in mruby-range-ext.",True,{}

I think ""Info"" is used only to skip (@dearblue right?),

Yes, ""Info:"" is used only for ""Skip:"" (and ""Info:"").
The reason is that even if the child assert skips, the parent assert continues without being skipped on the fly.
I needed to mention this in #4540.
If the parent assert should also be skipped on the fly, changes are welcome.

Changed the default value of assert and specify the argument explicitly at the caller of assert because it is unnatural ""Assertion failed"" is output even though the assertion doesn't fail.

It is not desirable to be ""Skip: Assertion failed"", and I welcome the correction.",True,{}

I think it is better to place all documentation tasks under the doc namespace (add doc_ prefix because minirake can't use namespace). Because it is consistent with GitLab tasks and user friendly for rake -T, etc. and shell completion.

There is sudo apt-get install doxygen in the failure message of capi_doc task, but I think this is somewhat inaccurate because it only works on specific platforms.

will return false for strings in .rodata. Change the lower bound from
_etext to __ehdr_start to catch these cases. This works for ld.bfd, gold
and lld, and it does not have false positives even if .init_array does
not exist.
Remove the branch that uses _edata: strings in .data can be modified so
this is semantically incorrect. Delete the __APPLE__ branch (its
manpages say get_etext() and get_edata() are strongly discouraged).
.init_array has been adopted by most ELF platforms to supersede .ctors.
Neither _etext nor _edata is used, so rename MRB_USE_ETEXT_EDATA to
MRB_USE_EHDR_START.

This removes code added by #3639 @Asmod4n You can use MRB_USE_CUSTOM_RO_DATA_P instead. The _edata approach can be wrong if the user modifies .data, so I don't think it makes lots of sense to support it by default.
Most ELF platforms support .init_array. For example, glibc has supported .init_array since 1999.
To use lld (LLVM linker), you can add -fuse-ld=lld to conf.linker.flags.
This option is supported by clang newer than Nov 9, 2013, and GCC 9 and newer.
Some Debian derivatives back port a patch to GCC 7 and 8.

Using the end of .data or __data is dangerous. .data is writable (SHF_WRITE on ELF platforms), so its contents (e.g., interned strings) can be modified.
Uses who understand the implication can write
static mrb_bool

The #warning preprocessor directive is not standard.
I think many compilers support it, but it's a proprietary extension (you can check it with gcc -Wpedantic, clang -Weverything, etc.).
A compiler that does not understand #warning may generate an error.
This is preferable because #pragma message(""Warning message"") is not an error even if the compiler does not understand it.
However, it is annoying that some compilers understand #warning but don't understand #pragma message...
As a simple example, I confirmed it with Portable C Compiler (pcc).
If you are only interested in GCC (including clang), you can use #pragma GCC warning ""Warning message"".
That said, it's relatively new.

Why do you combine mrb_get_argc and mrb_get_argv, where mrb->argc is not supposed to be changed?


This is because I thought it was not good to have three functions that perform the same preprocessing.

I think my implementation also naturally supports %l, so I am not sure the essential difference from the matz implementation. My implementation is a method of specifying C type from Ruby (n.d(1) is int, n.s('str') is char*, n.l(2) is size_t, etc).


My implementation supports all specifiers combination up to 2 arguments.


I think that it is necessary to test patterns that are easy to make mistakes, such as when multiple specifiers, ending with %, etc. At least I can't always implement without mistakes when refactoring, improvement, etc. The implementation_dependant tests are also intended to show that users should not depend on these behaviors (e.g. ending with %in Ruby)

Cause
An entry of method cache is identified by class pointer and method
id. However, reusing memory after GC may create a class with the same
pointer as the cached class.

Cleared method caches of the class when the class is GCed.","First I worried little about performance impact. But classes and modules are rarely collected, so I will merge this PR as it is.",True,{}

Perform null termination using MRB_ALLOCV instead of RSTRING_CSTR in mrb_str_to_dbl.

It's successful","Considering possible compiled binary incompatibility, it might be better to recompile mrbc every time despite inefficiency.

Executable mrbc only runs on the current device (host). When running CrossBuild use mrbc which is already in the bin folder. Well, ExecTools limits only hosts can overwrite mrbc executables in bin

The CI fail from a stack overflow error. You need to pass CI before merging.

On Windows, if you give an invalid file descriptor to _get_osfhandle(), it seems to crash.
This will cause a crash if you give it to a POSIX compatible file function (such as fstat(), read() and write()).

Since we don't implement Bignums in mruby, we use Float numbers instead on overflow. So some integer calculations may result in float numbers. That's the reason we use float division by default instead of integer division.
The options for the future are:

make division integer division by default (this PR; compatible with Ruby)
1.1.  overflow should make float as it does now (inconsistency? maybe)
1.2.  overflow should raise an exception (big limitation; acceptable?)
1.3.  implement Bignum using mpz or some other library (need more RAM)
make division float division as it is now

Summary of changes


Work around MSC and MSC++ compiler bug where it would optimize away a union access which may contain a static value in random.c


Updated appveyor config, added MS 2019 compilers, and uses the highest Ruby version available on the appveyor image


Removed special compiler flags in github actions MSC build


Description
Currently the tests with master fails with the Microsoft compiler v19 with optimizations enabled. This only happens with MSC and from what I can determine only with MSC > 19. The simplest reproduction is the Ruby expression from the Random test
[1, 2].shuffle Random.new
Passing a Random instance to an Array causes a segfault. I have some insight as to what happens though I do not know how to fix it besides disabling optimization entirely for the mrb_ary_shuffle_bang C function.
With optimizations enabled the MSC compiler infers some hard coded values incorrectly and stores them in registers. Code down the line treats the values in the registers as pointers which leads to a crash. I've tried expanding all the macros out, setting intermediate values as a part of the macro expansion, and marking the suspect variables as volatile. Using declspec(noinline) on all relevant functions it still does not fix it. Nothing I know how to do forces the compiler to stop over optimizing and generating hard numbers. However, I am no expert and I am well out of my depth at this point trying to debug optimized code.
More in depth, the MSC compiler hard sets register rbx to a literal 0x18 value when casting to rand_state *. This causes the pointer to go wild later in random_rand trying to follow a pointer to memory address 0x18


It also setsrsi to 0x2 breaking C calling conventions and overwriting the pointer to the mrb_state* stored inrsi.","Quite the interesting issue here.

Version 19.22 generates correct code.
Minimal example code that reproduces issue: https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/GBgNYT
Top-right is correct code with v19.22
Bottom-right is bad code with v19.23
It has following two instruction that causes crash:

        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rdx]

It looks that newer MSVC versions do not like how mrb_value unions work in mrb_ary_shuffle_bang function - when changing nil type to Random type something goes wrong and pointer p in mrb_value is incorrectly used.

Summary of changes


Work around MSC and MSC++ compiler bug where it would optimize away a union access which may contain a static value in random.c


Updated appveyor config, added MS 2019 compilers, and uses the highest Ruby version available on the appveyor image


Removed special compiler flags in github actions MSC build


Description
Currently the tests with master fails with the Microsoft compiler v19 with optimizations enabled. This only happens with MSC and from what I can determine only with MSC > 19. The simplest reproduction is the Ruby expression from the Random test
[1, 2].shuffle Random.new
Passing a Random instance to an Array causes a segfault. I have some insight as to what happens though I do not know how to fix it besides disabling optimization entirely for the mrb_ary_shuffle_bang C function.
With optimizations enabled the MSC compiler infers some hard coded values incorrectly and stores them in registers. Code down the line treats the values in the registers as pointers which leads to a crash. I've tried expanding all the macros out, setting intermediate values as a part of the macro expansion, and marking the suspect variables as volatile. Using declspec(noinline) on all relevant functions it still does not fix it. Nothing I know how to do forces the compiler to stop over optimizing and generating hard numbers. However, I am no expert and I am well out of my depth at this point trying to debug optimized code.
More in depth, the MSC compiler hard sets register rbx to a literal 0x18 value when casting to rand_state *. This causes the pointer to go wild later in random_rand trying to follow a pointer to memory address 0x18


It also setsrsi to 0x2 breaking C calling conventions and overwriting the pointer to the mrb_state* stored inrsi.","Oh brilliant! Round tripping to a temporary variable does work. That limits the scope to just this function and eliminates the need for pervasive volatile qualifiers, and my previous question is now invalid. However, running rake locally for compilation works using the default configuration, while using the compile flags in build.yml returns an error error C2678: binary '=': no operator found which takes a left-hand operand of type 'volatile mrb_value'
I guess this goes back to my original question about CI. The CI compiler settings are different than what the end user gets when running rake. Should we just remove the custom compiler flags from CI?

Do you mean running rake with -m? I did not add it, it was already there. The only CI changes I did was putting back the compiler optimization compiler flag from Github Actions, matching what the user gets when running rake; and adding the 2019 version to Appveyor. I suspect we removed the optimization flag from Github because we ran into compiler bugs at some point, and we did not have 2019 on Appveyor, so we were blind to this bug.


I don't think similar environments (e.g. MSVC 2019 64-bit) need to be tested on multiple CI platforms.


I agree. I've used the Windows Github actions platform and found it poor compared to Appveyor. I am in favor of removing the Windows Github action and make the Appveyor build the source for Windows.

Well that's a different issue. We test all MSC compilers back to the first 2013 version when MS initially made the compilers free. It looks like we only use current LTS supported Ubuntu compilers; so the last 5 years. If we support only the current MSC compiler year and the previous release, 2019 and 2017, that cuts it down to four builds. So revising the proposal

@shuujii I think this addresses your comments?","@shuujii has a good point on #5028 (#5028 (comment)) where running tests with -m makes interpreting test output difficult as all the output is mixed. I tried separating the build command using rake -m and the test command which does not use -m. However, building with -m and then testing without -m leads to some strange segfaults on all nix system, seen in this commit b3dace6
I can put the test back as one line using -m as that is what it was before. One, it is strange how the build process with -m causes a segfault. Two, I think it is a good point that running test with multitask makes output hard to figure out
I did turn on -v with tests though so we can see exactly what tests failed.",True,{}

Can you provide some examples? I wanted to make it accurate along with matz' corrections. I think this is an important tool for an embedded project.

Here are some examples. I'm not sure what value users typically expect or appropriate for the return value of ObjectSpace.memsize_of.

Currently, the method returns 0 for Symbol. However, creating one non-inline symbol uses one slot in mrb_state::symtbl (which may also uses a slot in mrb_state::symhash). Also, if the symbol name is not ro_data, allocate a buffer for it.
Currently, the method returns RVALUE size for shared String. In the case of shared Strings, I think shared buffer size (including size of mrb_shared_string) should be accounted for in one of the objects that share the same buffer. However, I don't think it's obvious which objects should be accounted for. Information may need to be added to RString to identify the object, even if it is clear. I don't think it's desirable to increase runtime costs and so on just for the feature.
Currently, the method retuerns 0 for Fixnum. However, it may be using a slot in literal pool.


I made a separated gem for memsize_of.

My intention was to provide it in a different repository than mruby/mruby (e.g. RoryO/mruby-os-memsize).
I personally feel that return value definition of the method is unclear. The meaning of the value may change due to changes in internal implementation because it strongly depends on the internal implementation.
Still, the methods may have some uses depending on the use case, but I'm a little wondering if it is necessary to officially provide such a seemingly unclear feature (also, I'm a little worried that the maintenance cost seems to be high against the frequency of use).
I agree with separating gems when maintaining in mruby/mruby because the method is required require 'objspace' in CRuby.",True,{}

I hope the review is not a burden.
This implements the mri method of ObjectSpace.memsize_of. With mruby we care a great deal about tracking resource use therefore I feel this is useful. All of the code is new, none copied. The mruby structures differ from C Ruby structures so existing C Ruby code isn't useful.
One difference between this implementation and the mri one is an addition of a recurse parameter. Specifying ObjectSpace.memsize_of obj, recurse: true will recursively descend into collection members and instance variables. Do let me know if I should not include this option and I will remove it.
Additionally, I added a protocol for MRB_TT_DATA objects. If a data object implements the memsize method this code will call that method and use it's return value for the size total.

#define mrb_static_assert(exp, str) typedef char _mrb_static_assert_id(_mrb_static_assert_)[(exp) ? 1 : -1]

Using struct instead of typedef seems to get rid of the warning.
#define mrb_static_assert(exp, str) struct _mrb_static_assert_id(_mrb_static_assert_) { char x[(exp) ? 1 : -1]; }

With gcc 9.3.0 on Ubuntu 20.04, build/host/src/array.d looks like:

Instead of build/repo/**/..., get the symbols only from the required mrbgem. Symbols contained only in the test will be extracted if necessary.
Instead of build/presym.inc, it will be output to build/<TARGET>/include/mruby/build/presym.inc.

Regular expressions are currently used to extract presym from Ruby files, but it is not strict, so I think it is better to use mruby itself (mrbc) to parse them.
For example, adding a class, method, or instance variable to one Ruby file will change symbol IDs, so most files, including C files, will need to be recompiled. This is inconvenient, especially for trial and error during development.

To achieve 1, the core would have to be built twice with and without presym, but I don't think that's a big deal for the following reasons:

If only mrbc is built, using ccache and parallel builds, even my low spec machine can build it in about 1 second.
If we can specify pre-built mrbc, we don't have to build it every time. Because I think there are not so many changes which affect the result produced by mrbc, this should  be fine in most cases.

Achieving 2 also has the side effect of speeding up compilation of Ruby files because we can always use optimally built mrbc (for this reason, my personal repository has been doing something similar for some time).
I'll try to build without presym. However, even if it does, it will probably be partially incompatible with the current presym (C macros change). Also, I think it will take a while.",True,{}

Things to notice

Based on CRuby, Range#size returns Float::INFINITY when it is endless. Under MRB_WITHOUT_FLOAT environment, we implemented to return nil for now.

Range#last

According to ISO, Range#last is an alias of Range#end (15.2.14.4.10), which is actually not the case in current Ruby anymore (e.g. Range#last can take 0 or 1 argument, but Range#end does not take arguments.). Since the core of mruby basically needs to follow ISO, those features in CRuby have been implemented as extension(mruby-range-ext) in current mruby.
In CRuby, Range#last raises a RangeError when it is endless. (while Range#end returns nil), so we implemented this feature to extension(mruby-range-ext)'s Range#last following that implementation.

Things to notice

Based on CRuby, Range#size returns Float::INFINITY when it is endless. Under MRB_WITHOUT_FLOAT environment, we implemented to return nil for now.

# CRuby(2.6.6)
2.6.6 :015 > (1..).size
 => Infinity

# mruby
> (1..).size
=> Infinity

# mruby (built with MRB_WITHOUT_FLOAT flag)
> (1..).size
=> nil


Range#last

According to ISO, Range#last is an alias of Range#end (15.2.14.4.10), which is actually not the case in current Ruby anymore (e.g. Range#last can take 0 or 1 argument, but Range#end does not take arguments.). Since the core of mruby basically needs to follow ISO, those features in CRuby have been implemented as extension(mruby-range-ext) in current mruby.
In CRuby, Range#last raises a RangeError when it is endless. (while Range#end returns nil), so we implemented this feature to extension(mruby-range-ext)'s Range#last following that implementation.

To implement Range#each, we need to prepare upto method of String wihich correspond to endless range separately from the existing String#upto (CRuby also takes the same steps).

Change entry list from segmented list to flat array.
Change value of hash bucket from pointer to entry to index of entry list,
and represent it by variable length bits according to capacity of hash
buckets.
Store management information about entry list and hash table to struct RHash as much as possible.

Change entry list from segmented list to flat array.
Change value of hash bucket from pointer to entry to index of entry list,
and represent it by variable length bits according to capacity of hash
buckets.
Store management information about entry list and hash table to struct RHash as much as possible.

Benchmark Summary
Only the results of typical situations on 64-bit Word-boxing are present
here. For more detailed information, including consideration, see below
(although most of the body is written in Japanese).

Compiles twice because it falls back to build.filename(command) when
command fails. This process was added at 9968af4 to support ccache gcc

build.filename(command) quoted the whole command, but now it does not

mrb files always start with RITE header mark. Probably you can use this to detect mrb files as well

Because mruby is more resource-saving oriented than CRuby, I think it's
better to reduce that.
In addition, the reason why 63 is used instead of 64 seems to be helpful as
follows.

You can build without presym by MRuby::Build#disable_presym.

disabled, therefore the mruby state variable is required. The macros can
be used when the variable name is mrb. If you want to use other variable
names, you need to use macros with _2 suffix, such as MRB_SYM_2.

Result
The number of lines in the presym file for all gems is as follows:

Build process
The new build process (with presym) is as follows:

Build mrbc without presym (more on building without presym later).
Compile Ruby sources to C struct format with the mrbc created in
step 1, and create mrblib.c and gem_init.c. Note that the symbols
in the created files are output as MRB_SYM family macros or
mrb_intern_lit instead of IDs (details will be described later).
C preprocessor processes C sources including the created files of
step 2 and outputs them as .i files. In these files, for example,
MRB_IVSYM(foo) is converted to <@! ""@"" ""foo"" !@> and
mrb_define_module(mrb, ""Foo"") is converted to <@! ""Foo"" !@>.
Scan the files created in step 3 and create presym and presym.inc
files.

The files created in step 2 should output all static symbols defined in Ruby
sources, including local variables, so we can detect all presyms by just
scanning C sources without scanning Ruby sources directly.
Further, by this process, the files to be scanned becomes the same as the
files to be compiled, so that there is no excess or deficiency.
Related changes
The following changes have been made in relation to realizing this feature.
Allow build without presym
It enables build without presym to achieve the ""Build process: 1"". This
incorporates #5202, see its issue for details.
Note that when presym is enabled, even adding a local variable to a Ruby
source may change contents of presym and require recompilation of almost
all C sources. This is inconvenient, especially during trial and error in
development, but this feature is also useful because it does not cause
this problem if presym is disabled.
Automatically create build target for mrbc without presym
The mrbc used in the ""Build process: 1"" will be built by automatically
creating a build target for it. The build name is SOURCE_BUILD_NAME/mrbc.
Constantize output of C struct format by mrbc
To realizing the ""Build process: 2"", as mentioned above, symbol IDs are not
output directly in C struct format output by mrbc. As a result, the output
becomes constant regardless of the state of presym at the time of mrbc
build, and it is possible to detect symbols of Ruby sources in the same way
as other C sources.
Note that mrb_intern_lit is used for symbols that do not become presym,
but in this state, the corresponding element in the symbol array cannot be
statically initialized, so it is initialized at run time (therefore, in this
case, the const qualifier is not added to the symbol array).
Specify arbitrary mrbc file
To realizing the ""Build process: 2"", enabled to specify mrbc created by
another build target or pre-built mrbc. Use MRuby::Build#mrbcfile = to
specify it explicitly. You can omit the ""Build process: 1"" by specifying
pre-built mrbc, and you can always use an optimized build to compile Ruby
sources faster. I think changes that affect the output of mrbc are rare,
so in many cases it helps to improve efficiency.
With presym, the build will be a little slower due to more build steps, but
this feature will improve it a bit.
Create presym files for each build target
This feature was proposed at #5194 and merged once, but was reverted in
5c205e6 due to problems especially with cross-compilation. It has been
introduced again because this change solves the problem.
The presym files will be created below.

build/NAME/presym
build/NAME/include/mruby/presym.inc

Other changes

Because presym detection accuracy is greatly improved as mentioned above,
MRuby::Gem::Specification#cdump? is set to true by default, and
disable_cdump is added instead of enable_cdump. Also, support for gem
specific presym files has been discontinued (#5151 (comment)).
Previously, mrbc was automatically created for the host build, but it
will not be created if the build target for mrbc mentioned above is
automatically created. At this time, mrbc file of the mrbc build is
copied to bin/.
Two types of .d files will be created, .o.d and .i.d. oThis is
because if .i depends on presym.inc, the dependency will circulate, so
the .d file cannot be shared.
Changed file created with enable_cxx_exception to X-cxx.cxx from
X.cxx to use the mruby standard Rake rule.

Note
Almost all C sources will need to be recompiled if there are any changes to
persym.inc (if not recompiled properly, it will often result in run-time
error). If gcc toolchain is used, dependencies are resolved by the .d
file, so it become automatically recompile target, but if not (e.g. MSVC),
it is necessary to manually make it recompile target.
Also, even if gcc toolchain is used, it may not become recompile target if
external gems does not use the mruby standard Rake rule. In particular, if
the standard rule is overwritten, such as
https://github.com/mruby/mruby/pull/5112/files, .d file will not be read,

Note
Almost all C sources will need to be recompiled if there are any changes to

error). If gcc toolchain is used, dependencies are resolved by the .d

it is necessary to manually make it recompile target.
Also, even if gcc toolchain is used, it may not become recompile target if

Build process
The new build process (with presym) is as follows:

Build mrbc without presym (more on building without presym later).
Compile Ruby sources to C struct format with the mrbc created in
step 1, and create mrblib.c and gem_init.c. Note that the symbols
in the created files are output as MRB_SYM family macros or
mrb_intern_lit instead of IDs (details will be described later).
C preprocessor processes C sources including the created files of
step 2 and outputs them as .i files. In these files, for example,
MRB_IVSYM(foo) is converted to <@! ""@"" ""foo"" !@> and
mrb_define_module(mrb, ""Foo"") is converted to <@! ""Foo"" !@>.
Scan the files created in step 3 and create presym and presym.inc
files.

The files created in step 2 should output all static symbols defined in Ruby
sources, including local variables, so we can detect all presyms by just
scanning C sources without scanning Ruby sources directly.
Further, by this process, the files to be scanned becomes the same as the
files to be compiled, so that there is no excess or deficiency.
Related changes
The following changes have been made in relation to realizing this feature.
Allow build without presym
It enables build without presym to achieve the ""Build process: 1"". This
incorporates #5202, see its issue for details.
Note that when presym is enabled, even adding a local variable to a Ruby
source may change contents of presym and require recompilation of almost
all C sources. This is inconvenient, especially during trial and error in
development, but this feature is also useful because it does not cause
this problem if presym is disabled.
Automatically create build target for mrbc without presym
The mrbc used in the ""Build process: 1"" will be built by automatically
creating a build target for it. The build name is SOURCE_BUILD_NAME/mrbc.
Constantize output of C struct format by mrbc
To realizing the ""Build process: 2"", as mentioned above, symbol IDs are not
output directly in C struct format output by mrbc. As a result, the output
becomes constant regardless of the state of presym at the time of mrbc
build, and it is possible to detect symbols of Ruby sources in the same way
as other C sources.
Note that mrb_intern_lit is used for symbols that do not become presym,
but in this state, the corresponding element in the symbol array cannot be
statically initialized, so it is initialized at run time (therefore, in this
case, the const qualifier is not added to the symbol array).
Specify arbitrary mrbc file
To realizing the ""Build process: 2"", enabled to specify mrbc created by
another build target or pre-built mrbc. Use MRuby::Build#mrbcfile = to
specify it explicitly. You can omit the ""Build process: 1"" by specifying
pre-built mrbc, and you can always use an optimized build to compile Ruby
sources faster. I think changes that affect the output of mrbc are rare,
so in many cases it helps to improve efficiency.
With presym, the build will be a little slower due to more build steps, but
this feature will improve it a bit.
Create presym files for each build target
This feature was proposed at #5194 and merged once, but was reverted in
5c205e6 due to problems especially with cross-compilation. It has been
introduced again because this change solves the problem.
The presym files will be created below.

build/NAME/presym
build/NAME/include/mruby/presym.inc

Other changes

Because presym detection accuracy is greatly improved as mentioned above,
MRuby::Gem::Specification#cdump? is set to true by default, and
disable_cdump is added instead of enable_cdump. Also, support for gem
specific presym files has been discontinued (#5151 (comment)).
Previously, mrbc was automatically created for the host build, but it
will not be created if the build target for mrbc mentioned above is
automatically created. At this time, mrbc file of the mrbc build is
copied to bin/.
Two types of .d files will be created, .o.d and .i.d. oThis is

Note that mrb_intern_lit is used for symbols that do not become presym,
but in this state, the corresponding element in the symbol array cannot be
statically initialized, so it is initialized at run time (therefore, in this
case, the const qualifier is not added to the symbol array).
Specify arbitrary mrbc file
To realizing the ""Build process: 2"", enabled to specify mrbc created by
another build target or pre-built mrbc. Use MRuby::Build#mrbcfile = to
specify it explicitly. You can omit the ""Build process: 1"" by specifying
pre-built mrbc, and you can always use an optimized build to compile Ruby
sources faster. I think changes that affect the output of mrbc are rare,
so in many cases it helps to improve efficiency.
With presym, the build will be a little slower due to more build steps, but
this feature will improve it a bit.
Create presym files for each build target
This feature was proposed at #5194 and merged once, but was reverted in
5c205e6 due to problems especially with cross-compilation. It has been
introduced again because this change solves the problem.
The presym files will be created below.

build/NAME/presym
build/NAME/include/mruby/presym.inc

Other changes

Because presym detection accuracy is greatly improved as mentioned above,
MRuby::Gem::Specification#cdump? is set to true by default, and
disable_cdump is added instead of enable_cdump. Also, support for gem
specific presym files has been discontinued (#5151 (comment)).
Previously, mrbc was automatically created for the host build, but it
will not be created if the build target for mrbc mentioned above is
automatically created. At this time, mrbc file of the mrbc build is
copied to bin/.
Two types of .d files will be created, .o.d and .i.d. oThis is
because if .i depends on presym.inc, the dependency will circulate, so
the .d file cannot be shared.
Changed file created with enable_cxx_exception to X-cxx.cxx from
X.cxx to use the mruby standard Rake rule.

Note
Almost all C sources will need to be recompiled if there are any changes to
persym.inc (if not recompiled properly, it will often result in run-time
error). If gcc toolchain is used, dependencies are resolved by the .d
file, so it become automatically recompile target, but if not (e.g. MSVC),
it is necessary to manually make it recompile target.
Also, even if gcc toolchain is used, it may not become recompile target if
external gems does not use the mruby standard Rake rule. In particular, if
the standard rule is overwritten, such as
https://github.com/mruby/mruby/pull/5112/files, .d file will not be read,
so be careful.","If we copy presym.inc in the host build to include/mruby/presym.inc when building mruby, we may be able to build without adding to include path in most cases.

The new build process (with presym) is as follows:

Build mrbc without presym (more on building without presym later).
Compile Ruby sources to C struct format with the mrbc created in
step 1, and create mrblib.c and gem_init.c. Note that the symbols
in the created files are output as MRB_SYM family macros or
mrb_intern_lit instead of IDs (details will be described later).
C preprocessor processes C sources including the created files of
step 2 and outputs them as .i files. In these files, for example,
MRB_IVSYM(foo) is converted to <@! ""@"" ""foo"" !@> and
mrb_define_module(mrb, ""Foo"") is converted to <@! ""Foo"" !@>.
Scan the files created in step 3 and create presym and presym.inc
files.

The files created in step 2 should output all static symbols defined in Ruby
sources, including local variables, so we can detect all presyms by just
scanning C sources without scanning Ruby sources directly.
Further, by this process, the files to be scanned becomes the same as the
files to be compiled, so that there is no excess or deficiency.

The following changes have been made in relation to realizing this feature.
Allow build without presym
It enables build without presym to achieve the ""Build process: 1"". This
incorporates #5202, see its issue for details.
Note that when presym is enabled, even adding a local variable to a Ruby
source may change contents of presym and require recompilation of almost

development, but this feature is also useful because it does not cause
this problem if presym is disabled.
Automatically create build target for mrbc without presym

sources for presym. C preprocessor can perfectly interpret all comments and
preprocessor directives, so it can detect all symbols defined, for example
mrbgems/mruby-socket/src/const.cstub.
Also, as described later, this change will greatly improve the accuracy of
presym detection from Ruby sources.
Result
The number of lines in the presym file for all gems is as follows:
Previous:   999 (false positive = 89, undetected = 297)
New:       1207
Build process
The new build process (with presym) is as follows:

Build mrbc without presym (more on building without presym later).
Compile Ruby sources to C struct format with the mrbc created in
step 1, and create mrblib.c and gem_init.c. Note that the symbols
in the created files are output as MRB_SYM family macros or
mrb_intern_lit instead of IDs (details will be described later).
C preprocessor processes C sources including the created files of
step 2 and outputs them as .i files. In these files, for example,
MRB_IVSYM(foo) is converted to <@! ""@"" ""foo"" !@> and
mrb_define_module(mrb, ""Foo"") is converted to <@! ""Foo"" !@>.
Scan the files created in step 3 and create presym and presym.inc
files.

The files created in step 2 should output all static symbols defined in Ruby
sources, including local variables, so we can detect all presyms by just
scanning C sources without scanning Ruby sources directly.
Further, by this process, the files to be scanned becomes the same as the
files to be compiled, so that there is no excess or deficiency.
Related changes
The following changes have been made in relation to realizing this feature.
Allow build without presym
It enables build without presym to achieve the ""Build process: 1"". This
incorporates #5202, see its issue for details.
Note that when presym is enabled, even adding a local variable to a Ruby
source may change contents of presym and require recompilation of almost
all C sources. This is inconvenient, especially during trial and error in
development, but this feature is also useful because it does not cause
this problem if presym is disabled.
Automatically create build target for mrbc without presym
The mrbc used in the ""Build process: 1"" will be built by automatically
creating a build target for it. The build name is SOURCE_BUILD_NAME/mrbc.
Constantize output of C struct format by mrbc
To realizing the ""Build process: 2"", as mentioned above, symbol IDs are not
output directly in C struct format output by mrbc. As a result, the output
becomes constant regardless of the state of presym at the time of mrbc
build, and it is possible to detect symbols of Ruby sources in the same way
as other C sources.
Note that mrb_intern_lit is used for symbols that do not become presym,
but in this state, the corresponding element in the symbol array cannot be
statically initialized, so it is initialized at run time (therefore, in this
case, the const qualifier is not added to the symbol array).
Specify arbitrary mrbc file
To realizing the ""Build process: 2"", enabled to specify mrbc created by
another build target or pre-built mrbc. Use MRuby::Build#mrbcfile = to
specify it explicitly. You can omit the ""Build process: 1"" by specifying
pre-built mrbc, and you can always use an optimized build to compile Ruby
sources faster. I think changes that affect the output of mrbc are rare,
so in many cases it helps to improve efficiency.
With presym, the build will be a little slower due to more build steps, but
this feature will improve it a bit.
Create presym files for each build target
This feature was proposed at #5194 and merged once, but was reverted in
5c205e6 due to problems especially with cross-compilation. It has been
introduced again because this change solves the problem.
The presym files will be created below.

build/NAME/presym
build/NAME/include/mruby/presym.inc

Other changes

Because presym detection accuracy is greatly improved as mentioned above,
MRuby::Gem::Specification#cdump? is set to true by default, and
disable_cdump is added instead of enable_cdump. Also, support for gem
specific presym files has been discontinued (#5151 (comment)).
Previously, mrbc was automatically created for the host build, but it
will not be created if the build target for mrbc mentioned above is
automatically created. At this time, mrbc file of the mrbc build is
copied to bin/.
Two types of .d files will be created, .o.d and .i.d. oThis is
because if .i depends on presym.inc, the dependency will circulate, so
the .d file cannot be shared.
Changed file created with enable_cxx_exception to X-cxx.cxx from
X.cxx to use the mruby standard Rake rule.

Note
Almost all C sources will need to be recompiled if there are any changes to
persym.inc (if not recompiled properly, it will often result in run-time
error). If gcc toolchain is used, dependencies are resolved by the .d
file, so it become automatically recompile target, but if not (e.g. MSVC),
it is necessary to manually make it recompile target.
Also, even if gcc toolchain is used, it may not become recompile target if
external gems does not use the mruby standard Rake rule. In particular, if
the standard rule is overwritten, such as
https://github.com/mruby/mruby/pull/5112/files, .d file will not be read,
so be careful.",@dearblue Thank you for the reports.  I will investigate.,True,{}

Don't know how to build task '/var/tmp/mruby/build/cross-mingw32/bin/mruby-config.exe' (See the list of available tasks with `rake --tasks`)
I think I was able to build it before, but as far as I can see mrbgems/mruby-bin-config/mrbgem.rake, It's trying to ignore it in cross build.

  
    
      mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-config/mrbgem.rake
    
    
         Line 1
      in
      08d4365
    
  
  
    

        
          
           unless MRuby::Build.current.kind_of?(MRuby::CrossBuild) 
        
    
  


However, MRuby::Build.current and MRuby::CrossBuild.current are treated differently and were not previously ignored as intended.

  
    
      mruby/lib/mruby/build.rb
    
    
         Line 119
      in
      08d4365
    
  
  
    

        
          
           MRuby.targets[@name] = self.class.current = current = self 
        
    
  


I fixed it and made it output in the form of a warning so that I could see that it was ignored.

I tried to fix it for the following reasons.

MRB_E_SYM is confusing with MRB_SYM_E thus I would like to avoid it.
MRB_E_SYM is not used in the first place.

However, this PR was wrong because I misunderstood the behavior of MRB_E_SYM.

If mruby/presym.h is not included before mruby.h, MRB_SYM is not defined here, so mrb_intern_lit() version seems to be used everytime.

Indeed. I didn't realize it because it was originally the case. Should we just change it to something like #define MRB_E_SYM(sym) mrb_intern_lit (mrb, #sym) here?

The only difference between the two versions of MRB_E_SYM() is slight performance.

Yes. So at first I thought we didn't have to use MRB_SYM in E_xxx_ERROR.

So unless the source file uses MRB_SYM() in it (as described in doc/guides/symbol.md), I don't think we need to include mruby/presym.h (to avoid unnecessary recompilation).

If we use MRB_SYM we need mruby/presym.h, and if we use E_xxx_ERROR MRB_SYM is also used, so I think we can't compile without including mruby/presym.h.",True,{}

CRuby throws an exception from throw only when there is no corresponding catch.
So in CRuby, if you have a corresponding catch, you won't get caught in arescue in the middle.
I think the reason mruby derives from Exception is that it doesn't get caught easily with rescue => e.
We can do the same with mruby by throwing a RBreak object, but before that, the challenge is how to register / unregister a symbol with catch and how to find it with throw.",True,{}

does not print anything in CRuby, but mruby does. We implemented only one global jump using exceptions. So I don't think this PR is a good idea. It could cause more problems than its benefit.

Reasons for separating everything but the Binding#eval method as mrbgems/mruby-binding-core
To separate the dependency on mruby-compiler.
It would be nice to have a binding for remote control, but I don't think the mruby-compiler is always needed on the receiving end in that case.
I'd like to try something like kishima-san's remote mirb at some point.
(youtube) Remote mirb on M5Stack using mruby/c
Reasons for separating the Proc#binding method as mrbgems/mruby-proc-binding
Because there are methods in core mrbgems that return proc/lambda objects, we want to minimize the problems that can arise from being able to manipulate internal variables.
By keeping them separate as different mrbgem, each user can decide if they want to include them or not.

Limitations

The maximum number of local variables (bind.eval(""var = 1"") or bind.local_variable_set(:var, 1)) that can be added is 50 (net is 49 because self is included).
This is defined as the MRB_IREP_LVAR_MERGE_LIMIT constant (can be specified in build_config in the range 8..240).
It is precomputed before variables are taken in, and if the result exceeds the limit, all local variables before the addition are lost and an exception is raised.

Implementation Overview

Extend the private global function mrb_exec_irep() defined in src/vm.c to allow specifying a hook function to be called when returning from a given proc.
If a binding object is specified in Kernel.#eval, the return from eval is now hooked and the defined local variables are incorporated into the binding object.
The binding object will hold a proc object that will be used as a space for dynamically added local variables. From this variable space, it references the calling proc.

The variable defined in binding.eval cannot be referenced well from within the proc object.
bx = binding
block = bx.eval(""a = 1; proc { a }"")
bx.eval(""a = 2"")
p bx.local_variable_get(:a)
p block.call  # Expect 2 but return 1 due to a bug
The cause is that even after eval ends, the proc inside keeps the old proc and keeps referencing that variable.
This conceals the a in the variable space that the binding object holds directly.
As a fix, I'm currently thinking of pre-parsed and merging variables before doing eval inside binding.eval.",True,{}

Using a pre-commit framework speeds up development as a lot of tests can be run on the local machine giving instant feedback.  So we don't have to wait for the CI / GitHub actions to run to get feedback.  The pre-commit automatically fixes some of the issues when you do git commit and if there are any issues the tests are marked as red failed.  Then you will need to commit again so that all the tests pass green.
There are many more pre-commit checks listed here -> https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html

Now, when I run pre-commit run --all-files, I see that ruby30 was called several times.
I can also confirm that this change also causes errors in .pre-commit-config.yaml.


Currently it is run as yamlint --strict . but I don't think it is necessary to specify the directory.

The previous implementation of Binding#eval evaluated the code and then merged the top layer variables.
This patch will parse and expand the variable space before making a call to eval.
This means that the call to Binding#eval will do the parsing twice.
In addition, the following changes will be made:

Make mrb_parser_foreach_top_variable(), mrb_binding_extract_proc() and mrb_binding_extract_env() functions private global functions.
Remove the posthook argument from mrb_exec_irep().
The posthook argument was introduced to implement the binding method.
This patch is unnecessary because it uses a different implementation method.

fixed #5491","Previously the following code did not produce the expected results:
bx = binding
block = bx.eval(""a = 1; proc { a }"")
bx.eval(""a = 2"")
p block.call  # Expect 2 but return 1 due to a bug
The previous implementation of Binding#eval evaluated the code and then merged the top layer variables.
This patch will parse and expand the variable space before making a call to eval.
This means that the call to Binding#eval will do the parsing twice.

For now, the solution is to create a proc object for the origin binding object with the Binding#initialize_copy method.

But there is a concern, and if it repeats binding.dup.dup.dup.dup....., the proc gets deeper and deeper. Therefore, I think it is necessary to perform two more processes.

(1) If there is no local variable, do not link to origin proc
(2) If proc->upper seems to be too deep, raise an exception as ""mruby limit""

% bin/mruby -e 'p [**1]'

% ruby31 -e 'p [**1]'
-e:1:in `<main>': no implicit conversion of Integer into Hash (TypeError)
I also found a problem where the hash object is destroyed when it is expanded as a keyword argument at the beginning of the argument.
% bin/mruby -e 'h = {}; p(**h, a: 1, b: 2); p h'
{:a=>1, :b=>2}
{:a=>1, :b=>2}

% ruby31 -e 'h = {}; p(**h, a: 1, b: 2); p h'
{:a=>1, :b=>2}
{}
The solution I came up with after viewing the irep for the above two problems is to add an implicit empty hash by codegen.c if the first element of NODE_KW_HASH is NODE_KW_REST_ARGS.
I've mimicked the behavior by hand, and it seems to be the result I'm expecting.
% bin/mruby -e 'p [**{}, **1]'
-e:1: Integer cannot be converted to Hash (TypeError)

Release notes
Sourced from actions/cache's releases.

v3.0.0


This change adds a minimum runner version(node12 -> node16), which can break users using an out-of-date/fork of the runner. This would be most commonly affecting users on GHES 3.3 or before, as those runners do not support node16 actions and they can use actions from github.com via github connect or manually copying the repo to their GHES instance.


Few dependencies and cache action usage examples have also been updated.

As far as I can tell, the script shown does not crash mruby 3.1.0-rc2.
It crashes after commit a4f740f + 1a9991f.
The reason for the crash in the example taken is that RSTR_EMBEDDABLE_P(len = -1) is true before str_init_embed(), resulting in an illegal write (buffer over run).
Last but not least, even mruby 3.1.0-rc2 can return control normally from a call to mrb_sys_fail().

Note that previously the variable i was updated at that time, but since it is the same as the value at the end of a for statement, it has been omitted.
The original catalyst was that bin/mrbc with the MRB_WORD_BOXING + not MRB_BOXWORD_NO_FLOAT_TRUNCATE configuration caused bin/mrbtest with the MRB_NO_BOXING configuration to fail.
