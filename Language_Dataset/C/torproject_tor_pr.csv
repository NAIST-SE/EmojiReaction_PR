Hi @TorProject!

My name is isis; I work for The Tor Project.  We appreciate you mirroring our
stuff to Github, but (afaik) none of us know who you are or have any contact
with you or involvement in this (apologies if I'm mistaken about this), which
could be pretty confusing for other people who are new to hacking on tor.  (Even
though you've made it super clear that this is unofficial, and it doesn't look
like anything malicious is going on here.)  Maybe we should be thinking about
ways to make it official?  If you want to reach out to us at
tor-team@lists.torproject.org, we'd be happy to talk about ways that we can
possibly collaborate on an official Github mirror.

Thanks!

Best regards,
isis agora lovecruft

 @teor2345 requested changes on this pull request.

 DNS queries provide a vector for a malicious directory authority to
 de-anonymise clients. So we might only want to allow domain name resolution in
 test networks, or networks which are using non-default authorities.

 When using default authorities, we should probably ban the use of DNS names.
If we agree (and we do) that using DNS resolution in production would
introduce a potential vulnerability, then I'm becoming convinced it's
probably not a good idea to allow it in test mode either -- why should
we support a behavior in testing that's not actually going to be
allowed when doing it ""for real"" ? :)

As such, I'd like to withdraw my original patch/request/RFE :)

That being said, we now have a weird situation where it is possible to
resolve hostnames IFF they begin with a digit, even though they are
NOT an IP address (e.g. ""2byfour.example.net""). I'm talking about
here:

diff --git a/src/or/config.c b/src/or/config.c
index 94a58f348..e43b58356 100644
--- a/src/or/config.c

   addrport = smartlist_get(items, 0);
   smartlist_del_keeporder(items, 0);
+  /* XXX address here should be an IP, NOT a hostname starting with a digit! */
   if (addr_port_lookup(LOG_WARN, addrport, &address, NULL, &dir_port)<0) {
     log_warn(LD_CONFIG, ""Error parsing DirAuthority address '%s'"", addrport);
     goto err;

I'm not familiar enough with the code base to have a good feel for
what should be done. Perhaps addr_port_lookup() should accept a Boolean
flag telling it whether it's OK to resolve hostnames or IP addresses
only, and when called from here we'd set that to False ?

Elsewhere in the code (e.g., src/or/routerparse.c, function
authority_cert_parse_from_string(), cca. line 2376) a combination of
tor_addr_port_split() and tor_inet_aton() is used to the same effect,
so there appear to be many possible ways to code this, and as I mentioned,
I'm not familiar enough with the code to tell which way is the *right* way...

Please feel free to close the trac ticket with something like
""notabug"" as well :)

Thanks much,

there are a small number of Bridges (or EntryNodes),
they are all marked as IPv4-preferred when they are loaded, and
the device running tor only has IPv6.

We can fix this bug in a few different ways:

make sure we always fall back to non-preferred addresses if all preferred addresses fail:

we will find these bugs when we test


reset the preferred flags on all nodes if all preferred addresses failL

I think we should remove the flag instead


stop setting the IPv6 preferred flag on nodes:

simply not bootstrap and thus not start properly. Commit 67a41b6
removed that requirement for tor to be considered a ""client"".
Unfortunately, this made the mainloop enable basically nothing if only the
ControlPort is set in the torrc.
This commit now makes it that we also consider the ControlPort when deciding
if we are a Client or not. It does not revert 67a41b6 meaning
options_any_client_port_set() stays the same, not looking at the control port.

Signed-off-by: David Goulet dgoulet@torproject.org","It turns out that if only the ControlPort is set and nothing else, tor would
simply not bootstrap and thus not start properly. Commit 67a41b6
removed that requirement for tor to be considered a ""client"".
Unfortunately, this made the mainloop enable basically nothing if only the
ControlPort is set in the torrc.
This commit now makes it that we also consider the ControlPort when deciding
if we are a Client or not. It does not revert 67a41b6 meaning
options_any_client_port_set() stays the same, not looking at the control port.
Fixes #27849.

In some extreme cases, it lead to the expiry of the certificate which triggers
a BUG() when encoding the descriptor before uploading.
Ticket #27838 details a possible scenario in which this can happen. It is an
edge case where tor losts internet connectivity, notices it and closes all
circuits. When it came back up, the HS subsystem noticed that it had no
introduction circuits, created them and tried to upload the descriptor.
However, in the meantime, if tor did lack a live consensus because it is
currently seeking to download one, we would consider that we don't need to
rotate the descriptors leading to using the expired signing key certificate.
That being said, this commit does a bit more to make this process cleaner.
There are a series of things that we need to ""refresh"" before uploading a
descriptor: signing key cert, intro points and revision counter.
A refresh function is added to deal with all mutable descriptor fields. It in
turn simplified a bit the code surrounding the creation of the plaintext data.
We keep creating the cert when building the descriptor in order to accomodate
the unit tests. However, it is replaced every single time the descriptor is
uploaded.

In conn_close_if_marked(), we can decide to keep a connection open that still
has data to flush on the wire if it is being rate limited on the write side.

still have token in its bucket and thus not stop the reading. This lead to a

that could get triggered if the user cancels bootstrap via the UI in
TorBrowser. This would cause Tor to call managed_proxy_destroy() which
called process_free() after it had called process_terminate(). This
leads to a crash when the various process callbacks returns with data
after the process_t have been freed using process_free().
We solve this issue by ensuring that everywhere we call
process_terminate() we make sure to detach the managed_proxy_t from
the process_t (by calling process_set_data(process, NULL)) and avoid
calling process_free() at all in the transports code. Instead we just
call process_terminate() and let the process exit callback in
managed_proxy_exit_callback() handle the process_free() call by
returning true to the process subsystem.

In this patch we lower the log level of the failures for the three calls
to unlink() in networkstatus_set_current_consensus(). These errors might
trigger on Windows because the memory mapped consensus file keeps the
file in open state even after we have close()'d it. Windows will then
error on the unlink() call with a ""Permission denied"" error.
The consequences of ignoring these errors is that we leave an unused
file around on the file-system, which is an easier way to fix this
problem right now than refactoring networkstatus_set_current_consensus().

A fullscheduler run might not handle all cells because it depends on the
available space in the TCP buffer for the socket. What KIST does at the moment
is reschedule itself in 10ms (static value), the KISTSchedRunInterval
parameter. This is done so we can properly handle priority between circuits
with this grace period (mostly loud vs quiet circuits).
The problem is that if tor has very few sockets to handle, like most Tor
clients they have a single connection to their Guard, then it process that
what it can (usually in couple msec) and then sleep for the remaining time.
That remaining time would be between 8 and 9 msec doing nothing even though
bytes might be ready to be sent.
This caps a tor client to a maximum of ~3MB/sec (experimental results) instead
of being able to push much more if needed, let say a bulk download.
With this, we are bringing down the cell scheduler interval only for clients
to 2msec. Relays stay on 10msec because they handle a large amount of sockets
and thus there is no starvation on that side.

The hashed hard-coded password is ""password"".
The first time it's started, Tor bootstraps without any issues. After a SIGNAL SHUTDOWN is sent on the control port, Tor will shutdown cleanly and then immediately restart. At this point Tor will sit there and do nothing. It's not frozen because it answers on the control port: for instance, while it's in that state, a GETINFO status/bootstrap-phase will immediately return the current bootstrap phase (0%).
After some debugging, we realized that some periodic events are static, and after the first run they would keep the enabled flag set to 1. Thus, during the next mainloop initialization, they would not be connected since they looked like they already were.
This PR simply sets them back to enabled = 0 when they are disconnected.

int main() {
  fprintf(stdout, ""Starting first time...\n"");

  fprintf(stdout, ""Starting second time...\n"");
  run();
  fprintf(stdout, ""Tor finished\n"");

  return 0;
}

The hashed hard-coded password is ""password"".
The first time it's started, Tor bootstraps without any issues. After a SIGNAL SHUTDOWN is sent on the control port, Tor will shutdown cleanly and then immediately restart. At this point Tor will sit there and do nothing. It's not frozen because it answers on the control port: for instance, while it's in that state, a GETINFO status/bootstrap-phase will immediately return the current bootstrap phase (0%).
After some debugging, we realized that some periodic events are static, and after the first run they would keep the enabled flag set to 1. Thus, during the next mainloop initialization, they would not be connected since they looked like they already were.
This PR simply sets them back to enabled = 0 when they are disconnected.
I'm not particularly familiar with Tor's codebase, so feel free to close this PR or suggest changes if you think there could be a better way to fix it.","Thanks, I've opened a ticket for this issue in our bug tracker:

Once the GitLab-CI setup from  !1408 is merged, then I'll submit the final work for running these tests in the Android emulator in GitLab-CI.  That should be portable to Travis-CI as well.
@n8fr8","These fixes are quite simple, but there seems to be many requirements that are unclear to me.  So I'll leave this code as an example for someone who does know the requirements to use how they see fit under any license they want.

The reason for that is because the hs_circ_cleanup_on_free() function (which
can end up looking at the rend_cache) can be called from the
circuit_free_all() function that is called after the rend cache is cleaned
up in tor_free_all().
We could fix the free all ordering but then it will just hide a future bug.
Instead, handle a missing rend_cache as a valid use case as in while we are in
the cleanup process.
As Tor becomes more modular, it is getting more and more difficult to ensure
subsystem callstack ordering thus this fix aims at making the HSv2 subsystem
more robust at being called while tor is pretty much in any kind of state.

Here's my review of this PR:
If we want to change ""matrix"" to ""jobs"", we need to do that in a separate PR, because it needs to be backported (to avoid future merge conflicts).
Wee might want to check against python 3.6 or nightly, instead of python 2.7 (because it's not supported). Would you recommend:

3.6 (for the earliest supported syntax) or
nightly (to see upcoming syntax changes as soon as possible) ?

We do reviews and unit tests. Please create unit tests...

How can we help you create unit tests?
Some of our current tests mock (replace) is_local_addr(), but none of them actually test it.
It will be easier to test is_local_addr() if you split it into two different functions:

is_local_addr_impl(), which:

accepts as arguments:

a bool that says if we are enforcing distinct subnets
the other node's address
this node's IPv4 address
this node's IPv6 address, and


does the checks that is_local_addr() does now


is_local_addr(), which:

accepts as an argument:

addr, the other node's address, and


passes to is_local_addr_impl():

get_options()->EnforceDistinctSubnets
addr
last_resolved_addr
&(router_get_my_routerinfo()->ipv6_addr), if valid





Then you can add tests for is_local_addr_impl() in test_config.c.",True,{}

Yes, that's a big job, and it should be a new ticket.

Second, teor, could you please verify that I've divided is_local_addr() into two functions appropriately?

I've asked you to make some changes. is_local_addr() should be a small wrapper function, which passes the specific arguments to is_local_addr_impl(). That way, you can test is_local_addr_impl() by passing different arguments.

Could you then give me some hints as to how to get started with writing the unit test? Because I've been going through the existing ones and they are intimidating.

Here's an example of a similar test for tor_addr_is_internal():
It uses these two macros:

  
    
      tor/src/test/test_addr.c
    
    
         Line 98
      in
      384a771
    
  
  
    

        
          
           /** Helper: assert that <b>a</b> parses by tor_inet_pton() into a address that 
        
    
  


And these tests cases:

  
    
      tor/src/test/test_addr.c
    
    
         Line 345
      in
      384a771
    
  
  
    

        
          
           /* test internal checking */ 
        
    
  


There's a bit of work setting up the test wrapper functions. But you can focus on writing test cases for now. We want to test every combination:

EnforceDistinctSubnets on and off
IPv4 local and not local
IPv6 local and not local
IPv6 local: valid and invalid IPv6

Ideally, we also have tests for either side of any boundary condition.
For example, we should test IPv4 addresses in the same /23, /24, and /25.
And IPv6 addresses in the same /47, /48, and /49",True,{}

Fix some bugs in the new code:

2c1c348 pass the correct arguments to tor_addr_is_local_impl(), and simplify

b444c15 rewrite the comments that say what the function does

Use our standard test function conventions:

fb54494 use STATIC and the *_PRIVATE header area for test-only functions

You don't need to worry about these commits, they are our fault:
Coding standards and best practices:

1246932 allow a smaller number of extra lines, silence all warnings

resolution because it can't ask tor for a specific IP version with the SOCKS5

PreferIPv6 made it that sometimes the IPv6 could be returned to torsocks that
was expecting an IPv4.
Torsocks is probably a very unique case because the runtime flow is that it
hijacks DNS resolution (ex: getaddrinfo()), gets an IP and then sends it back
for the connect() to happen.
The libc has DNS resolution functions that allows the caller to request a
specific INET family but torsocks can't tell tor to resolve the hostname only
to an IPv4 or IPv6 and thus by default fallsback to IPv4.

Hi everyone!
I am working on a cross-platform Tor controller/wrapper, and I encountered a minor inconvenience while writing code for stopping Tor in Windows.
Currently the only way to gracefully terminate Tor in Windows is to use the control port to issue the SIGINT signal, it would be beneficial for 3rd party programs which work with Tor to be able to invoke this procedure by using the native ""control signals"" provided to console programs in Windows.
I have made a patch which implements this functionality, I will post it soon, I am creating this ticket so that I can create a corresponding file in the changes directory :)
Thanks to nickm for some pointers about using the libevent event_active function to trigger the event, I decided to use the activate_signal function as it internally calls the suggested function and simplifies the code.","This pull request is for Ticket #34211:

of bytes a TLS socket using read_to_chunk_tls() which boils down to SSL_read()

However, at the end of the loop, the returned number of bytes from
read_to_chunk_tls() was treated like the syscall read() for which if less
bytes than the total asked are returned, it signals EOF.
But, with SSL_read(), it returns up to a TLS record which can be less than
what was asked. The assumption that it was EOF was wrong which made the while
loop exiting before it was able to consume all requested bytes (at_most
parameter).
The general use case that Tor sees is that it will ask the network layer to
give it at most 16KB (that is roughly 32 cells) but because of KIST scheduler,
the highest possible TLS record we currently observe is 4096 bytes (4KB or 8
cells). Thus the loop would at best always return 8 cells even though much
more could be on the TLS socket. See ticket #40006 for more details.

Unfortunately, many functions had to be changed to accomodate but in majority
of cases, to become simpler.
Functions are also removed specifically those that were there to convert an
IPv4 as a host format to a tor_addr_t. Those are not needed anymore.
The IPv4 address field has been standardized to ""ipv4_addr"", the ORPort to
""ipv4_orport"" (currently IPv6 uses ipv6_orport) and DirPort to ""ipv4_dirport"".
This is related to Sponsor 55 work that adds IPv6 support for relays and this
work is needed in order to have a common interface between IPv4 and IPv6.
Closes #40043.

numbers, but after years of development we're not even close to 10
for any of our current versions.  We also have a convenient
workaround available in case we ever run out of protocols: if (for
example) we someday need Link=64, we can just add Link2=0 or
something.
This patch is a minimal patch to change tor's behavior; it doesn't
take advantage of the new restrictions.

that we ignore any port that is not the family of our default address when
parsing the port. So if port_parse_config() was called with an IPv4 default
address, all IPv6 address would be ignored.
That makes sense for ORPort since we call twice port_parse_config() for
0.0.0.0 and [::] but for the rest of the ports, it is not good since a
perfectly valid configuration can be:
SocksPort 9050
SocksPort [::1]:9050
Any non-ORPort only binds by default to an IPv4 except the ORPort that binds
to both IPv4 and IPv6 by default.
The fix here is to always parse all ports within port_parse_config() and then,
specifically for ORPort, remove the duplicates or superseding ones. The
warning is only emitted when a port supersedes another.
A unit tests is added to make sure SocksPort of different family always exists
together.

the Bridge line alone there leading to bugs like #25528

now check at the managed proxy list. In order to pull this off, the transport

I have no idea about the GNU configuration process in the first place. the only other thing I know to do here is read the rest of the patch and check to see if the autogen.sh configure and configure.ac files all hold those conventions, without understanding really the general structure of tor as a program. I'm very open to suggestions and want to learn, maybe what I submitted causes other errors? What do people do in this case to troubleshoot a safely integratable patch?

The first fail mentions the ASCIIDOC which is a package I downloaded off pacman in order to get tor to work on my arch system. Is each column listed on travis a VM, or are those steps of the compiling process? I read in my research today that clang is no longer supported by autoconf 2.70, but this was in a random other repository dealing with issues spurred by autoconf's update. yet again, not sure how to interperet any information i'm looking at, I'm a noob haha",True,{}

Yes, this line should be changed in the same manner too.
I just didn't sent a patch for that, because I wanted to concentrate

export the circuit id using haproxy. However, such directive is applied

some virtual ports.
We can do that by adding an optional flag to the HiddenServicePort
directive to specify that we will export the circuit id for such port.
The flag in HiddenServicePort will override the one in
HiddenServiceExportCircuitID, if it's not none. But it will use the
protocol specified in HiddenServiceExportCircuitID, if it's otherwise.
