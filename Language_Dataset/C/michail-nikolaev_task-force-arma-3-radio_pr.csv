I did the functions to load the settings file on preInit. Problem right now is CBA appears to dictate that all CBA_Settings.. settings have to be defined in userconfig\cba\settings.sqf. Because thats what https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3/tree/master/optionals/auto_load_settings_file uses.
But this way we can't distribute the config file to not let people overwrite the CBA settings file.
But i think that's kinda fine. As only serveradmins will use this we might just add a wiki entry on how to set these settings (I don't know how the settings.sqf file should look like yet). And there are only few people that use this anyway.
@zgmrvn please also remove the old userconfig folder in the PR.
Need some opinions on what to do with the settings file @kavinsky @michail-nikolaev
Im for just leaving it in userconfig\cba\settings.sqf and adding info to the wiki.
Also if we are implementing CBA settings we should do it completly not just partly right?
for example: https://github.com/michail-nikolaev/task-force-arma-3-radio/blob/master/arma3/%40task_force_radio/addons/task_force_radio/functions/fn_initialiseEnforceUsageModule.sqf should use CBA_settings_fnc_set. But.... I dont know what script would execute first.. If the userconfig loading from the server executes after the Module init, the userconfig might override the Module which we dont want.
But preInit runs before the variables are initialized in postInit. So I guess we could check if a variable exists in the userconfig init and if it already is just ignore the setting.
But that would only work if loadorder is
Module > preInit > postInit
But if the order is
preInit > postInit > Module or
preInit > Module > postInit
We are fine as the Module would overwrite the userconfig.",True,{}

I can implement a workaround for that.. which would add about 4 more lines of code to that area. Tell me if you are fine with that. Other solution would be to just not support any older versions. Which i wouldnt like.. because.. I dont like updating Teamspeak because I keep finding exploits for it.. There is a new crash exploit for the 3.1 client already.. and its still in beta...

grab getPluginPath as ptr and wrap into ptr for

 Add TFAR_isRadioProgrammer config entry concerning #1144 (comment)

Meaning 1000 additional vehicle classes per Radio.
Also ACE_Attach doesn't support assigned Items. Meaning it would only be attachable if the Radio is in the Inventory. Not in the Radio Slot. Ofcause that could theoretically be changed on ACE side.
But I am really not sure if we want another 6000 Vehicle classes (1000 for each Radio class) just for such a kinda small feature.
Also where should Lower Headset be placed? It would probably be easiest to just Place it into the Radios menu.. But it seems misplaced in a menu that otherwise only has Radios...
The Move Radios under Equipment has to be done in config.. That means we need to inherit.. which means we need to have a dependency on ACE.. So.. either we move everything to script or we move all ACE Interaction stuff to a optional ACE mod.. We will have optionals anyway for AI hearing so.. quite possible

Defining it as an array on top of the file means it can be used on whole file which is not really wanted behavior as you want to limit variable to only scope they are used.
Also problem that I saw in private ARRAY usage was that people tend to forget to update it when changing code where as having it on variable initialization makes it easier to remember.
Of course this it can look stupid in some of the files currently where there are dozens of variables defined, but I wanted to avoid changing code too much in this pull request and focus on just updating private.",True,{}

I think this is the best way of solving this problem but there might be better ones.
I have not found side effekts that could cause any problems with this soulution, but i am no expert with TFAR so there might be problems with this soulution that i have not considerd.
If this is not wanted for any reason feel free to reject this PR","ok, that dafinitly makes sense, just could not solve it differently since i havent learned how the plugin works yet :D",True,{}

Let people ACE Interact with a vehicle to pickup/put away an intercom phone, allowing them to speak on the intercom of any ground vehicle
Let people ACE Interact with a vehicle to connect wirelessly to the vehicle's intercom, allowing them to speak on the intercom of any ground or air vehicle, assuming that they're wearing compatible headgear
Whenever a player wearing a wireless compatible headgear jumps out of an intercom capable vehicle's non-cargo seat, they are automatically connected to the intercom wirelessly, so that they can continue talking on the intercom without having to interact
In all above cases, each of the two methods have their distinct maximum range of operation (Phone: 5m, Wireless: 15m). These values are customisable via CBA Settings

I'll be adding to this pull request with any suggested edits made, and by covering the below currently un-handled situations. I think I'm done in terms of adding new features. I'll also be making another pull request which will implement the physical telephone and rope, to add to immersion. So it turns out I've done everything in one pull request. Oh well.
Situations to handle correctly

 Player moves outside of the 5 meter limit -> Intercom phone disconnected
 Another player tries to pickup an intercom phone whilst someone else has already picked up the same phone -> Display an ""Intercom phone is in use"" ACE Interaction instead of the ""Pickup Intercom Phone"" ACE interaction. Also, Intercom phone will not activate if already in use, in case the ACE interaction is bypassed
 Player is killed, or disconnects from the server whilst connected to the intercom phone -> Intercom phone disconnected
 Player gets into the same vehicle they are connected to with the intercom phone -> Intercom phone disconnected
 Player gets into any vehicle whilst they are connected to the intercom phone -> will disconnect, though the distance checks should come into play if the vehicle the player is in, or the vehicle they are connected to move outside of the 5 meter radius
 Player picks up another intercom phone whilst still being connected to a different intercom phone -> will disconnect old intercom phone
 Player going unconscious (ACE) whilst being connected to the intercom phone -> will disconnect

Todo for this initial implementation (AKA 1.0?)

 Add: option to disable external intercom, or only same side can connect
 Add: Have wireless headgear reconnect automatically in case someone runs out of range by mistake. Make it so that they must disconnect via self interaction.
 Allow wireless users to change intercom channel
 Add: channel switch to phone panel, not self interact
 Add: attribute that can be added to individual vehicle from Eden, Config or Zeus(?) to customise max range of phone and/or wireless
 Fix: When jumping out of a vehicle, the intercom does stay connected wirelessly, but the icon doesn't appear?
 Fix: Rope breaking doesn't disconnect
 Fix: AI jumping out will show indicator icon, even if Zeus is not on intercom
 Fix: Now Headgear whitelist is suddenly not being transferred from server to client anymore...?
 When being connected to wireless intercom, and changing the ""Enable"" setting to ""Same side as Player"", ropes attach to all players currently connected to the wireless intercom. So, one of the 2 players was given the rope and phone, but not actually assigned as phone operator... Meaning that player now can't put away the attached rope and phone
 When one wireless user disconnects, all players lose the wireless indicator. This does not apply to someone when jumping in the vehicle (and wireless intercom disonnecting normally for them)
 When a phone user is connected, and a crew member jumps out of the vehicle, the phone and cable disappear but icon remains, and intercom is still connected
 When a wireless user takes helmet off, whilst another user is connected to wireless, it removes the phone and cable, but icon remains and intercom stays connected
 Changing server settings don't apply globally
 When no users are connected to the phone, but all are connected to the wireless, and the setting Enable is changed to something, then a random user (I assume first in the list) is actually connected to the phone instead of the wireless, and the other users are disconnected completely
 When 2 users connected wirelessly, and setting gone from 1 to 2, locally each user is still considered connected, but the TFAR_ExternalIntercomSpeakers variable of the vehicle is not syncronised so we're each seeing an option to disconnect ourselves
 When in crew seat, change to crew, then dismount. The channel will not remain on crew, it'll switch back to default
 Connecting to wireless, getting into crew position, then getting out will duplicate person entry in TFAR_ExternalIntercomSpeakers of the vehicle
 A player who isn't connected to intercom at all will have the icon appear randomly when another player jumps out of the vehicle
 Modded Vehicles don't have the Intercom Phone interaction points?
 Add entry to ACE Arsenal to indicate if a headgear is External Intercom Compatible
 When all users are connnected to the wireless and the Enable setting is changed to 2, the second player in the list still has the ""Disconnect Wireless"" ACE interaction showing on the vehicle, even though they've been otherwise completely disconnected
 A player (previously connected to wireless) isn't disconnected from the intercom when disconnecting from the server
 Fix: Make sure fnc_getIntercomChannel sorts the array by commander > gunner > driver > passengers instead of the current sorting Not so important if we just give the ability for the person to change channel themselves

Let people ACE Interact with a vehicle to pickup/put away an intercom phone, allowing them to speak on the intercom of any ground vehicle
Let people ACE Interact with a vehicle to connect wirelessly to the vehicle's intercom, allowing them to speak on the intercom of any ground or air vehicle, assuming that they're wearing compatible headgear
Whenever a player wearing a wireless compatible headgear jumps out of an intercom capable vehicle's non-cargo seat, they are automatically connected to the intercom wirelessly, so that they can continue talking on the intercom without having to interact
In all above cases, each of the two methods have their distinct maximum range of operation (Phone: 5m, Wireless: 15m). These values are customisable via CBA Settings

I'll be adding to this pull request with any suggested edits made, and by covering the below currently un-handled situations. I think I'm done in terms of adding new features. I'll also be making another pull request which will implement the physical telephone and rope, to add to immersion. So it turns out I've done everything in one pull request. Oh well.
Situations to handle correctly

 Player moves outside of the 5 meter limit -> Intercom phone disconnected
 Another player tries to pickup an intercom phone whilst someone else has already picked up the same phone -> Display an ""Intercom phone is in use"" ACE Interaction instead of the ""Pickup Intercom Phone"" ACE interaction. Also, Intercom phone will not activate if already in use, in case the ACE interaction is bypassed
 Player is killed, or disconnects from the server whilst connected to the intercom phone -> Intercom phone disconnected
 Player gets into the same vehicle they are connected to with the intercom phone -> Intercom phone disconnected
 Player gets into any vehicle whilst they are connected to the intercom phone -> will disconnect, though the distance checks should come into play if the vehicle the player is in, or the vehicle they are connected to move outside of the 5 meter radius
 Player picks up another intercom phone whilst still being connected to a different intercom phone -> will disconnect old intercom phone
 Player going unconscious (ACE) whilst being connected to the intercom phone -> will disconnect

Todo for this initial implementation (AKA 1.0?)

 Add: option to disable external intercom, or only same side can connect
 Add: Have wireless headgear reconnect automatically in case someone runs out of range by mistake. Make it so that they must disconnect via self interaction.
 Allow wireless users to change intercom channel
 Add: channel switch to phone panel, not self interact
 Add: attribute that can be added to individual vehicle from Eden, Config or Zeus(?) to customise max range of phone and/or wireless
 Fix: When jumping out of a vehicle, the intercom does stay connected wirelessly, but the icon doesn't appear?
 Fix: Rope breaking doesn't disconnect
 Fix: AI jumping out will show indicator icon, even if Zeus is not on intercom
 Fix: Now Headgear whitelist is suddenly not being transferred from server to client anymore...?
 When being connected to wireless intercom, and changing the ""Enable"" setting to ""Same side as Player"", ropes attach to all players currently connected to the wireless intercom. So, one of the 2 players was given the rope and phone, but not actually assigned as phone operator... Meaning that player now can't put away the attached rope and phone
 When one wireless user disconnects, all players lose the wireless indicator. This does not apply to someone when jumping in the vehicle (and wireless intercom disonnecting normally for them)
 When a phone user is connected, and a crew member jumps out of the vehicle, the phone and cable disappear but icon remains, and intercom is still connected
 When a wireless user takes helmet off, whilst another user is connected to wireless, it removes the phone and cable, but icon remains and intercom stays connected
 Changing server settings don't apply globally
 When no users are connected to the phone, but all are connected to the wireless, and the setting Enable is changed to something, then a random user (I assume first in the list) is actually connected to the phone instead of the wireless, and the other users are disconnected completely
 When 2 users connected wirelessly, and setting gone from 1 to 2, locally each user is still considered connected, but the TFAR_ExternalIntercomSpeakers variable of the vehicle is not syncronised so we're each seeing an option to disconnect ourselves
 When in crew seat, change to crew, then dismount. The channel will not remain on crew, it'll switch back to default
 Connecting to wireless, getting into crew position, then getting out will duplicate person entry in TFAR_ExternalIntercomSpeakers of the vehicle
 A player who isn't connected to intercom at all will have the icon appear randomly when another player jumps out of the vehicle
 Modded Vehicles don't have the Intercom Phone interaction points?
 Add entry to ACE Arsenal to indicate if a headgear is External Intercom Compatible
 When all users are connnected to the wireless and the Enable setting is changed to 2, the second player in the list still has the ""Disconnect Wireless"" ACE interaction showing on the vehicle, even though they've been otherwise completely disconnected
 A player (previously connected to wireless) isn't disconnected from the intercom when disconnecting from the server
 Fix: Make sure fnc_getIntercomChannel sorts the array by commander > gunner > driver > passengers instead of the current sorting Not so important if we just give the ability for the person to change channel themselves
