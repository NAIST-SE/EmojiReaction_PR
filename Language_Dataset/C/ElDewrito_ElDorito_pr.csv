Fixes voip being stuck in a disconnected state after a server crash or being kicked.
Adds a voip.retry command to restart the teamspeak client.
voip.enabled 0 and then 1 will reconnect to the server if they are in one.
voip server should adhere to banlist but the user needs voip.enabled 1 because only clients can view the ip of other clients for some reason. Also connecting players must be a player in-game or they will be kicked from teamspeak.
Limits what a user with a modified dll can do. (Currently anyone in the ts server can kick any other person or view another user's ip address)
Clears names speaking when another user is kicked or disconnected. Also clears all names when the teamspeak client is shutdown.

This implicitly blocks banned users because they can't establish a game connection if they're banned, and it blocks outsiders because there's no longer any predictable password. As you've probably seen, the current code (not your PR) is really just awful and was copied-and-pasted from (what looks to be) a tutorial with no attention to security at all. I'm glad that someone else took notice and was willing to improve it.
Since I'd feel bad accepting this pull request only for it to be thrown out when I'm done, perhaps I can upload what I have so far to a separate branch so you can finish it? It's been on the backburner lately and I won't be able to finish it for a long time otherwise. I have the server-side code and the handshake system mostly done; the TeamSpeak client code just needs to be filled in.

@maximumgame The console ui got ripped out 439697e so console.consoleQueue.pushLineFromGameToUI is no longer used.

This adds a little feedback to the user, they can easily see if they're talking, if they can or cannot talk and if push to talk is enabled. Currently the icons are in the game, but they're attached to halo 3's voice chat state data which is not functional. They're going to waste. Also, the old speaking player text was removed and has not yet been replaced, this is an option.
Have you tested this on your own and/or in a game with other people?
I've only tested the patch alone, with some debug commands as it is not currently attached to teamspeak. When it's actually being used, it'll probably need some more testing and refactoring might be necessary too. This is the first time I've used C++ so things could definitely be improved.
Required Tag Changes

Added a ""speaking_player"" string to display who's speaking on the HUD.
Removed broken statedata from voice chat icons.
Removed statedata from speaking player text.
Replace string on speaking player text.

These tag changes have been included in further detail with a TagTool script in the attached ZIP file.
VoIP Icons Tag Changes.zip
Other Information
To change the ""speaking_player"" string I needed to add a tag definition for unic. This could be refactored and isn't fully mapped out, but it's functional and not doing any harm. In general, changing the string is probably the roughest area due to my lack of experience with C++. I imagine that this could be refactored to improve performance, at the very least with use of boost. This method is more of a draft and while it does function should probably be rewritten when the patch is actually attached to teamspeak.
Without the other HUD tag modifications, the VoIP icons are above consumables. Saber put them there, they have been moved since Halo 3, and with the updated tags they'll look better. But if you're using old tags, they might look a little odd.

During testing I used commands to control the HUD.

Today I have been messing around with attaching this patch to the current voice chat system.
I realised that some command integration might be necessary, for example the voip.pushtotalk command might need to change the voice chat icon to push to talk, or just available. Also, if voip.enabled is toggled, the icon needs to change between none and available.
The problem is, since commands are all called at launch, they can cause the patch to run before tags have been loaded. This is something I've encountered before in testing so I just added a boolean value that can be used to break out of functions before tags are loaded.

Added the broadcasting icon on the radar.

Removed some handling for modded tags.

This adds a little feedback to the user, they can easily see if they're talking, if they can or cannot talk and if push to talk is enabled. Currently the icons are in the game, but they're attached to halo 3's voice chat state data which is not functional. They're going to waste. Also, the old speaking player text was removed and has not yet been replaced, this is an option.

Assuming the old halo 3 setup is desired, there's also a few things that work different, not example the client should not show up in the speaking player text, that should only show other players. I created a small document explaining how different widgets were be used in halo 3 since I forgot myself.
If there's anything else I can do to help let me know :)

Remove the HideScreen command. Screens are responsible for hiding themselves.
Move the commands into the ""Game"" module instead of making a new ""Web"" module. There's already a command in there for showing the server browser, so I'd like to keep things consistent for now and not draw too much attention to commands that most people won't need.
Allow passing in screen data as an optional argument to the ShowScreen command (and defaulting to {} if it's not given). You need to be careful with how you handle this so that arbitrary JavaScript code can't be executed with it. Make sure to parse the argument as JSON (checking for validity) and then re-serialize it into a string.
I was thinking that it might be a good idea to make the ShowScreen command host-only in order to make it harder to use custom screens to cheat. Would you agree?",True,{}

Yes, multiplayer N/A","Double quotes seem to be erased when commands are entered. So it gets a little hard to pass valid json without them.
I can just replace single quotes with double quotes as a workaround if that is acceptable but that seems a bit unintuitive and would need to be made clear to creators.
As for host-only, I'm not sure what the harm is in letting people use screens if they want, especially if someone creates a friends list type ui. Although there could always be a synced variable that allows or disallows the command if the host wants to allow it. But a screen could still be added to the game and overlayed without capturing the mouse whether or not this command is used.
Edit: Also want to add that strings that contain double spaces or more being passed would be erased to a single space due to the command parsing.",True,{}

Yes, multiplayer N/A","Ah, forgot that our command parser isn't terribly robust, it's been a while <_<
Maybe what you could do is just take the arguments following the screen name and shove them into an array, e.g. ShowScreen MyCoolScreen a b c d would generate { ""args"": [ ""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"" ] }. This is useful because the screen show mechanism also intentionally works as a sort of messaging system between screens, because the show event will be called even if the screen is already open. Developers could use this to replicate the HideScreen command if they want a togglable screen (e.g. pass ""close"" as an argument and then have the screen close itself in the show event).
Unfortunately it actually is currently possible to use the screen system to cheat, since screens can do things like access internal console variables. I suppose that this is probably an issue on its own though, so we can start with always allowing custom screens for now and then change it later if we decide that it's necessary. I'll come up with a workaround for safely accessing those internal values.",True,{}

Yes","Sorry for taking so long to review this. Shortly after I posted the original issue, our plans changed a bit and we weren't sure if we wanted to continue with this repository any more. We've decided recently that we're still interested in pushing out some sort of release.
Anyway, there's a security oversight in your implementation here. Since a global variable is being used to hold whether or not the user is authenticated, then anyone can open new connections and run any command they want as long as at least one authenticated connection is open. This can be solved by tagging each socket with its authentication state.
Also, the method you're using to generate a random password isn't very efficient. There's no need to use a while loop which generates bytes until it gets one that works. You can just store a string of the acceptable characters and then map bytes from the [0...256) range to the range of indices for that string.
Since we took so long to review this, I'm going to go ahead and accept this PR and make these changes myself. We don't want things to be held up in case you aren't around anymore.",True,{}

It's not flawless though.
The main issue with the scaleform scoreboard is that, when teams get unorgamized, it fails to track ranking within teams.
For example, if a player is on pink, and another is on red, the scoreboard will probably not list any players.
The issue is kind of random, sometimes it will just resolve itself and display players anyway. I've managed to pinpoint the main symptom in the scripting, the team_players_ranking vector is being populated with the new teams, but the new teams within that vector are not being populated with GL_ScoreboardRanking indices.
Again, for standard lobbies this won't be an issue, games, as long as teams are in order it works fine.

The HUD behaved like this in Halo 3. Halo: Online introduced a lot of bugs with HUD globals, this is probably one of them. Without this patch, HUD distortion is applied in third person, which makes no sense, as in third person the player isn't looking through a visor.

Added a sound when the player activates Push-To-Talk, with a command toggle. Defaults to on.


Fixed all Voice Chat related HUD widgets. All states now display corrected.


Restored the speaking player HUD Text Widget. Defaults to off with a command to toggle. Enabling this will disable the speaking player overlay text.


Added commands to Stop and Start Looping Sounds. (Thanks to @unk-1 for the stop lsnd pointer!)


Added Tag Definitions for eqip, unit, bipd, scn3


Refactored the Ui patch, including the removal of all hard coded tag indices.


Why should this pull request be merged?
Added a sound to give ptt users some more feedback. This sound was still references in tags, and Saber did update some of the voice chat related widgets, so this is probably what they intended.
Fixing the HUD widgets now allows users to tell when their voice is being detected, or if a voice chat error has occurred the unavailable icon will appear.
All of the code for the speaking player text widget was left in from my first implementation, so out of personal preference I restored it. Personally I think showing the name of the player who's talking next to the icon on the HUD is more suitable and easier to see than the current overlay solution. But that's just my opinion, so this is togglable with a command, disabled by default.
Since a PlaySound command is already implemented, I believe a PlayLoopingSound and StopLoopingSound command is a nice addition.
Bipd and Unit definitions were required to remove tag indices, these were pulled straight from the TagTool and translated to C++.  I created an eqip definition quite some time ago but never needed to commit it. I thought it might help someone out to have it available. The scn3 definition is from a draft implementation of map images.
I noticed that GetTagAddressImpl was being repeated, so I moved it to TagInstance under the command IsLoaded(tagGroup, tagIndex). I also seperated all code related to reading tags and storing default values to remove repeated booleans and reduce error.

Currently there is no way to reload variants that you add to ""./mods/maps"" or ""./mods/variants"" without restarting the game.

Tested alone.
Test procedure.

Start game as normal
Go into ./mods/maps or ./mods/variants and add new content
Run ""Game.ReloadVariants""
