To answer your question: the file you referred was created using logger.
If you need to compute top-n stats, you can try the module by Dominik Tran: https://github.com/CESNET/Nemea-Modules/tree/topn/topn
It cannot be merged yet because the coding style must be improved.

It means we would have to write filters in apostrophes 'SRC_IP == ""2001::1""' or escape quotes""SRC_IP == \""2001::1\"""" because of the shell processing.

Oh, I see. I am sorry, I did not know, I am not a Fedora user.

The question is, whether we really want to allow interpreter from environment - @krkos ?

Based on information above, probably not. The philosophy in RH distros is such and I believe it is the primary development and deployment platform (although Travis runs on Ubuntu), so I would advise to follow the guidelines.
On the other hand, the tests currently do not pass for me in-tree. I have to at least compile a ""test"" version of pytrap (for reference: krkos/Nemea-Framework@2805fb9 ) and to install it so that it does not conflict with system stuff, I use virtualenv.
To sum it up, I do not care much about this change, I can keep a local copy. The testing problem should be fixed in another way. Perhaps by inspecting the Travis configuration?

Since @cejkato2 asked explicitly about performance:

This feature should have log complexity for look-up, which should be better for longer lists of IP ranges.

Judging by the resize strategy when loading the networks from configuration file, I guess that the network count will be usually in the lower tens in which case the sequential matching would be most likely faster than random access pattern introduced by binary search (random access to RAM is surprisingly slower than sequential and iirc to caches too - I remember reading a nice comparison quite recently which, of course, I can't find now).
All-in-all, my guestimate is that the potential performance hit will be negligible (at least its absolute value) and unless the speed is super-critical I'd go with cleaner code and better software architecture. Otherwise, benchmark of real-world workload is unavoidable I am afraid ;)",True,{}

This framework will help us create clearer unit tests. It is intended for C / C ++ code.
How integration is set up
The Googletest repository is downloaded as a submodule, which must be compiled as a library. It is not recommended to have Googletest installed, see FAQ. So during the make check the library will be compiled once. If you modify the unit test or add another one, the library will not be recompiled. Neither tests nor the library will be compiled during make.
By default, googletests will be used during make check. Even during configuration, no flag needs to be set. (Because it makes more sense to implicitly use all the tests that are available). If the user downloads the repository using a git clone without the --recurse-submodules flag, then ./configure will report a warning that googletests will be skipped. During the make check, the user will then see ""skipped"" for the tests to make it clear that some tests are not in use.
Cons and Pros
Primer
From my point of view, it's nice that the tests don't have to be registered. Dependencies are handled only in Makefile.am, and even in the main.cpp file, other .cpp tests are not included.
However, there may be a problem with a longer translation. It may take a few tens of seconds to translate the library. There's probably not much you can do about it.
It may make more sense to translate a library as dynamic than static... Maybe I'll change it.

I marked the problem with ""Explicit null dereferenced"" in the files endiverter.c and prefix_tags.c as false positive.
Consider this pseudo-code:

while(!stop) {
