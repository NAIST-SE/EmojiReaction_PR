Here is my implementation of zooming and panning for the patcher. The new UI interactions are as follows:

Mouse wheel events control zoom in and out for a PatchFrame; zoom occurs relative to the mouse pointer
Zoom can also be controlled via View menu items and their associated keyboard shortcuts
Holding the middle mouse button and dragging initiates a pan

Everything else should function roughly as usual. The zoom shouldn't have any effect on the structure of the patch itself. In some cases, there was a bit of complexity involved in achieving this. I've done a bit of testing, but I'm sure there are probably some lingering issues. I'm going to continue testing as we review the changes. I thought it would be good to get it in front of you now.
Known Issues

Graph/plot objects are not being repainted properly under zoom in live mode, working on fix

Id like to resolve this and get it into the new dev branch (experimental)
Im not 100% sure of the status though..
my observations are, outstanding changes required are:
a) use the downloaded user guide rather than a checked in version
b) ""launching doxygen by build.xml, could replace launching Markdown.pl""
seems reasonable , so we use doxygen instead of markdown.pl
(this will link into (a))
c) due to (b)  we then need to update platform_osx and platform_linux to ensure doxygen is installed.
(my concern here is travis needs to be able to build the documentation for release)
is this a correct summary?

Eliminate the IS-A relationship between PatchGUI and Patch; create a clean separation between PatchModel and PatchView. A PatchView redraws itselfs when the PatchModel has changed.
Ideally, the PatchModel should be ignorant of all details of how it might be displayed or processed.
Try to ensure that everything that is touched by SimpleXML persistence doesn't call or depend on Swing.
Create corresponding View classes for various parts of the model, objects, attributes, parameters, displays, etc. Move everything rendering related out of the pure model classes. This will make it easier to develop alternative renderers. Model updates flow back from GUI event handling code into the model, so technically our Views are more like ViewControllers.

Lisa","Hi,
These patches allow modifiers to be used when typing values into dials, e.g. 'x' for ratios, 'h' for frequencies, 's' for periods, 'd' for decibels, '/' for bpms. 'k'ilo and 'm'illi prefixes are supported, and extraneous spaces and letters should be silently eaten. I've tried to make it as ""do what I mean"" as I could without making it contradictory, ambiguous, or unpredictable.
I'm sure there'll be room for improvement, but I thought I'd get this out there.

Lisa","Thanks for these changes.
I discussed this with @JohannesTaelman , the conclusion was:
we definitely want to use flow execution order in the future (thank you for implementing)
however, we need to supply a logical migration path for users, and supporting two execution orders is likely to confuse...
so the current idea is we would activate this on a 'major update release', so that users are 'ready' for more major changes... this would become the new model.
to help with migration etc.
a) a method will be added to allow users to override execution order on patches
b) old patches migrated to use (a) so that their existing behaviour does not change.
thats current idea... if you have others would be cool to hear.
we will also need to look at the impact on things object references (e.g. tables) and also send/receive.
so for now, Ive updated the new experimental branch  (our new dev branch) with your changes to support the new EO, but Ive not taken the patch settings/ui code, as this will be subject to change due to the above.
(your changes are in PatchModel.java, I applied them manually, as the code has since be refactored to support MVC)
Thanks

It just timed out I think. I don't have write access to the main repo so I can't manually restart. The build will restart if you close and open the pull request though.
What is the exception that is thrown here in JDK10? Looking at the docs for 10, the original methods are still there. It seems like getLength() should be equivalent exactly like you have here though. I think the distinction is that if you hold a reference to the Position object that getEndPosition() returns, it will track the end position over time as edits are made and maybe this is useful if you have other Position objects around. But we were just discarding that reference immediately, getting the length should be the same thing.
I'm a little bit surprised that this is the only spot that fails under JDK10. As far as I know, there hasn't been a significant effort to target versions more recent than 8; that's sort of the current canonical API level for the project. But the build process ultimately uses whichever system java it finds; it doesn't enforce using a particular API level. I don't think that there are significant technical reasons why we can't target more recent versions. It's just going to take a bit of testing to find issues.
