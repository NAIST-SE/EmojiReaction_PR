You will find three rpm files under /rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/ directory.  One is the main program, the other two are debug stuff.
TODO

Plotting multiple lines only displays the first line
Probably more, need to do some more testing

Both are examples.
As you can see there, the function should be defined as :

Tried linking with luajit, and testing if it works. Yes, it needs one change though, which works with lua-5.1 too, and was probably a good idea to have in first place. The name luaL_reg was deprecated in Lua 5.1 (src: here), it should always have been luaL_Reg. Without this luajit, and future versions of Lua fail to compile. This needs updating one line in lua.c.


Tried linking with lua-5.4, it fails to compile because luaL_register was removed. src-1 mentions a new recipe using; src-2 mentions a compatible way of migrating (look at the bottom of page) , src-3 gives a complete higher level list for migration (you might not need this). I know this one from using my own lua modules in LuaTeX: the end of the .lua module files always return a table, and the sourcing lua file stores that table in a local variable, this way a module ideally doesn't add anything to global name space (not even ""name"" of module, as the sourcing file uses local variable name). So, I think this will be a breaking change. Somehow the new lua files will receive a table of functions that they can assign to a local variable named sc, the rest of the file won't need any change. I think this will remain backwards compatible with luajit (which btw is not worth loosing, luajit way faster and can approach C speed for loopy arithmetic calculations). Check where luajit stands: https://julialang.org/benchmarks/. Ideally, sc-im will try to first link to luajit: pkg-config --exists luajit...",True,{}

But it breaks lua 5.1, and more importantly luajit functionality. We just need #if LUA_VERSION_NUM >= 502 in one more place like he has put in lua.c, for it to compile for either lua 5.1 or higher. In my local patch, I got that to work. Also as I suspected, users won't have to update their lua files with local sc = require(""sc"") as his change writes to the global modname, so that's good too.
The testing is limited because of some bug introduced by your commit 383ae36 that added @ston to dependency graph.

Lua scripts that write to the same cell in which they are triggered from using =@ston(@lua(""scriptname.lua"",0)), end up writing the cell with 0.00 when @ston finishes; that overwrites whatever <value> user intended to write to the cell using sc.lsetnum(sc.curcol(),sc.currow(), <value>) .
Try running =@now in some random cell after running a  =@ston(@lua(""scriptname.lua"",0)), it will run =@ston(@lua(""scriptname.lua"",0)) again from cell that you run =@now in. If the scriptname.lua writes to the next cell, each run of =@now will write time to that cell, and whatever scriptname.lua writes to adjacent cell.
Lua scripts withsc.lquery are misbehaving. This is what I notice: If have a sc.lquery in a script, with every run of =@ston(@lua(""scriptname"",0)) the number of times user has to enter carriage return increases by one. So, if I am running the script Nth time (sequentially from N different cells), I need to hit <CR> N times before it would actually capture the user input & complete to move to the next lua statement.

Am new to GitHub collaboration, should I pull @amuramatsu's changes and create a new patch? Also, I have created another ticket #508 to track/discuss the issues caused by commit 383ae36",True,{}

Your previous suggestion should work equally well and complies with the standard AFAICT so (personally) I would prefer it over this one.

I checked that frozen and hidden columns still display properly.
If something broke, it should be veryvisible and obvious.

A short is not a natural value on most CPU architectures. The masking of
top bits is often necessary to conform to the C standard. So an int is
more efficient.",True,{}

go up with 'k' until row 159 is the lower row visible
go up again with 'k'. row 159 is still visible, but row 158 not. BUG
go up again and now row 158 appears again..
go up again with 'k' until you have at the bottom the rows 159,158,113 and 112.
go up again with 'k', 159 158 remain at the bottom. but rows 113 and 112 disappear.
you can go up until A0
the rows 159 158 113 and 112 wont show up but
the curious thing is that here it shows:
first 30 rows, below that row 30, the rows 66 and 67 which are frozen,

Yes, but I'm thinking of a way to deal with all frozen areas in a

Some screen scrolling cases were using the screen height to determine
the size of the scroll. This didn't take into account the fact that some
cells can have more than one line, and if there are a lot of frozen rows
then the scroll size was too big. That kind of thing.

I do not know if you are fully blind, or are going blind, but when I switched
to an all meat diet, ( I eat raw meat today ) my vision and eye health
drastically improved.

I was born with a significant sight condition that quickly worsened
when I reached 18. So no diet is going to help me.

Contrasted with some research I have done, vegans who are the opposite,
some end up going blind by the time they are 33 years old

deficiencies of this man.""
