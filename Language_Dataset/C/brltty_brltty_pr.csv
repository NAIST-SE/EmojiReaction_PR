I'll answer your questions here, but it'd be far better for you to subscribe to
brltty's mailing list. Go to brltty.com, click on Contact, and follow the
instructions.
Could you create a brailleback modification so that it recognizes braille
lines per usb and serial port?
No, because we don't maintain BrailleBack. I'm not even sure that Google still
maintains it. We maintain brltty, and it does recognize USB devices on Android.
Although it managed to connect brltty with the android does not work well
since the focus does not follow the braille line and for that reason in
android you can not look down in a list used navigation braille brailleback
line this works wonders
Yes, it does, but you just need to know how to do it. Brltty places the cursor
where the focus is. You can then move around the screen without changing the
focus, but, by pressing the leftmost routing key you can bring the focus to
wherever you are.",True,{}

I cross-checked the codes with wikipedia and the tables inside Mac OS's

The names are the same as used by VoiceOver on Mac.
They look correct to me since, when I switch to the Ukrainian or Russian
speech synthesizer, they are read as expected.
FYI, I am a native speaker of both languages. :)

I made a mistake. My Unicode table calls \u0407 and \u0457 the letter YI (with
no accent). Is the letter YI the same as an I with a diaeresis?

It also says that they're just Cyrillic, i.e. no reference to either
Byelorussian (that's the way Unicode spells it) or Ukranian.

Might it be that a Byelorussian or Ukranian I is a standard Cyrillic I with a
diaeresis?

Thanks. I feel safe in changing the commented name, now. I like to make the
names be the very same as Unicode calls them, but I'm cautious when it's a

Also, is there a way to separately test and validate just the ttb table first? I see there's a brltty-ttb binary, but neither -h, nor -H explain what it does, and there's no manpage either.
BTW, the existence of -H argument itself seems quite unnecessary when its output differs from that of -h by just one extra line documenting the -T argument.

The middle line here is input and the last one is output. This doesn't look
valid at all to me, but more than that, I can't even understand what is going
on and how on earth to fix this.
Since it's a language and a braille code that I don't understand, I'll need
some help before I can be helpful. One thing that I'd for sure find helpful is
knowing wht actually is expected. It'd also help me if the bits of data could
have identifying prefixes, e.g. ""input:"" ""actual output:"", and ""expected
output"".
Also, is there a way to separately test and validate just the ttb table first?
I see there's a `brltty-ttb` binary, but neither `-h`, nor `-H` explain what
it does, and there's no manpage either.
Just run brltty-ttb with the table as its only operand.
BTW, the existance of `-H` argument itself seems quite unnecessary when its
output differs from that of `-h` by just one extra line documenting the `-T`
argument.
Maybe it seems unnecessary, but, please, don't be that way. Tehre's a reason -
you just don't know it.

We have an API for processing options, and brltty itse4lf has lots of them.
That's why -h and -H exist - -H doesn't show the options that most brlrty users
aren't interested in and would consider to be little more than unwelcome noise.
brltty-ttb, of course, uses that same option processing API, and it just so
happens that it only has one of those options. Do you really expect me to mess
up the whole mechanism just because you think that, in a case or two, it seems
unnecessary?

Yes please!

I would also suggest to implement some sort of automated testing of
tables, similar to liblouis. It seems you already have most of the
necessary tools in place, all that is needed now is to script them.

Here's a Lithuanian pangram text:

Įlinkdama fechtuotojo špaga sublykčiojusi pragręžė apvalų arbūzą.

When running it through `brltty-ctb` with -t parameter, I would expect
the first letter to be lowercased and prefixed by something (dollar
sign, I guess), but all other text to remain intact, because the
mappings of lowercase letters, spaces and the full stop character are
identical between 6-dot (Contraction) and 8-dot (Text) tables. But
instead, all letters with diacritics are replaced with basic latin
letters, control characters or other characters. Here's the output as
displayed by `less`:

$/linkdama fechtuotojo apaga sublyk^Miojusi pragr^Y~^W apvals arbkz^E.

NG stands for Next Generation. eSpeak-NG is the successor of the eSpeak project. The original eSpeak is not developed anymore. I have no problem with using ""ng"" as driver code.

No. Unfortunately, they're just out-of-date. I'd rather have them consistently

Do you know when Fedora will update LibLouis to at least 3.4.1? There are
cursor routing issues in releases earlier than that. 3.5.0 should be out within
a week or so, now.

I don't know, and it seems there aren't currently plans to do that. But when 3.5.0 comes out, I will file a bug against liblouis in bugzilla.

Hi:
I don't know, and it seems there aren't currently plans to do that.
My Fedora 27 system has liblouis-2.6.2, and that's old. Orca relies on it, so
it does matter. Also, brltty now has support for using liblouis and it'd be
nice to eventually let it take care of contracted braille support.
when 3.5.0 comes out, I will file a bug against liblouis in bugzilla. Just
to save the maintainer the effort of updating to 3.4 and then to 3.5.

Yes. 3.4.0 had a couple of problems, hence the 3.4.1 bug-fix release, but
waiting a few days for 3.5.0 would indeed be the better choice.

Signed-off-by: Fabrice Fontaine fontaine.fabrice@gmail.com","I guess the difference with Debian is the ctng_n64part?
The ABI is incompatible with that of the selected emulation error message looks to me like an incoherency between what gcc produces and what ld expects, i.e. rather a bug in the toolchain.
Using gcc -shared instead of ld -r is questionable, because the wording is not really the same in the respective documentations:

gcc -shared: Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to form an executable.
ld -r: Generate relocatable output---i.e., generate an output file that can in turn serve as input to ld.

and the results indeed looks very different e.g. on x86:
$ file gcc-shared-output.o ld-r-output.o
gcc-shared-output.o: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, BuildID[sha1]=c52c1208cfeb208b1b8704588d04ed619355a37e, not stripped

We were also a bit confused about this issue during this patch review, you can see our full discussion here: https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/972614
At that time, I tried to understand why on these toolchains, by default, ld wanted to link a 32 bits binary.  I found that an other possible worakaround would have been to set LD to $(TARGET_LD) -melf64ltsmip
Arnout explained me that

in general, it is possible that additional options have to be passed to ld to
make sure it creates the correct type of ELF file. The buildroot toolchain-wrapper makes
sure that the correct options are passed but as brltty calls ld directly so it bypasses those.

it most assuredly isn't right. Without even looking, I can guarantee to you
that it isn't even working correctly in your case. The absence of an error
message doesn't mean a good build. It's just that you'd only see the problem if
your users were using certain braille devices that use that particular macro.

autoconf should be setting $LD to the correct version of ld within the
toolchain. If it isn't then it might be that you're setting $LD to ld before
the configure. As long as $LD isn't preset then autoconf should be doing the
right thing.

 I myself agree with you but, the last time this issue came up, Samuel and
 Sébastien didn't.
Oh, I didn't remember.
 I believe the argument was that assigning a malloc()ed string needs to
 be supported.
Looking back in my mails, I find this:

«
it means for instance that if somebody wants to do something like:

brlapi_connectionSettings_t *parameters(some args) {
        brlapi_connectionSettings_t *ret = malloc(sizeof(*ret));
        asprintf(&ret->auth, ""%something"", args...);
        return ret;
}

freeparameters(settings) {
        free(settings->auth);
        free(settings);
}

int main(void) {
        brlapi_connectionSettings_t * settings = fillparameters(args...);
        brlapi_openConnection(settings);
        freeparameters(settings);
}

He'd now have to put casts in various places to avoid warnings, making
programming more tedious than needed.  In general, one can see that libc
etc. never put consts in structures etc. even if it would make sense,
because of that problem.

Since these consts will not be very useful for optimization anyway
(while they will in other places you have changed), I think they would
bring more harm than good here.
»

Mario, does putting const here actually avoid some casts in your code,
or is it mostly about documenting the ownership?

 Mario, does putting const here actually avoid some casts in your code,

I came across this issue while trying to write Rust bindings for BrlAPI.
Rust uses a tool called bindgen to automatically generate the low-level
code from a C header file.  It infers mutable fields
for the connection settings struct, which is at least inconvenient
since Rust strings are basically never mutable.
It is very likely that there are workarounds on the Rust side for this,
but its sort of stricter type system makes at least pretending that
something is mutable pretty hard.  I can manually change
these fields on the rust side from *mut to *const, so there are ways to
work around this.  However, I would have prefered to not have to do
this.

Also, its not quite clear to me when malloc'ed strings should be
deallocated.  Once brlapi__openConnection was successful?
Or once brlapi__closeConnection was called?
I.e., does BrlAPI take ownership of auth and host fields?
If no, how long does it hold onto those?

 I think they don't need to stay allocated that long.

 In my understanding, it does not.
Yes, it does not.

I'd say the rust bindings autogeneration reason seems more useful than
the need for cast in the C case, then, and we can merge it.

Thanks. Done. I rebased it so it won't close automatically and I'd appreciate
it if this could be done for me.

Doesn't work. It says that ""close"" isn't a repository.

   hub pull close 247
   fatal: 'close' does not appear to be a git repository

Note that I did ""hub"", not ""git hub"". When I mkae it a subcommand of git, I

Absolutely! I use it for things like creating pull requests, and it works just

From the Fedora package named hub. Now I'm about two Fedora releases behind the

recent?

I hardly believe it's that recent. But I seem to remember that there
were several implementations of this hub subcommand so you may want to
check that we use the same.

Are you able, for instance, to comment on a pull request with it?

Hi:

hub pull comment xxx

work for you?
No, it doesn't. hub --help says this:

These GitHub commands are provided by hub:
   api            Low-level GitHub API request interface
   browse         Open a GitHub page in the default browser
   ci-status      Show the status of GitHub checks for a commit
   compare        Open a compare page on GitHub
   create         Create this repository on GitHub and add GitHub as origin
   delete         Delete a repository on GitHub
   fork           Make a fork of a remote repository on GitHub and add as remote
   issue          List or create GitHub issues
   pr             List or checkout GitHub pull requests
   pull-request   Open a pull request on GitHub
   release        List or create GitHub releases
   sync           Fetch git objects from upstream and update branches

So, as you can see, there's simply no ""hub pull"". This is what I'd expect since
pull is a git command and the argument after ""git pull"" needs to be the name of
a remote. I'm wondering, therefore, if the version of hub that you're using
contains a non-standard enhancement or more.

I told you, it introduces a ""hub"" sub-command thanks to git's mechanism
that I already explained. ""pull"" is thus a subcommand of that hub
subcommand. Definitely the program you are usign is different from mine.
I wouldn't say mine is strictly more powerful because there might be
things mine can't do, but as far as pull requests and issues are
concerned, my program can definitely do more. You can comment on pull
requests and issues, view them in the ocnsole, close them. You could

Yup, unfortunately we really have to. There is no way around it and it is safe
because users can only have one graphical session by definition. Some people
have not accepted that one yet though.
I myself am not a graphical user, so I might be wrong, but, as I understand it,
there's the multi-seat thing. To me, that means more than one graphical
session.
The thing is that the processes of the graphical session end up being started
by systemd. And then they technically don't actually belong to any user
session. There are some further long term ideas and more details … but right
now, guessing is definitely the right thing to do!
If there really is a right way to guess then shouldn't the place with the best
access to the data, i.e. (in this case) systemd, be providing a functino to do
it? I don't think it's right for a bunch of user code to implement that stuff
as it usually means not only that it might be done wrong but also that it won't
get fixed when there's a better way.

We are trying hard to kill that. It has been utterly broken since forever, but unfortunately people hold on to that idea because it kind of worked in the past, even though it is really bad.
If you run startx, then sd_pid_get_session will find it.
However, if you start a modern GNOME desktop (KDE is following, so is everyone else), then it will not work. What GNOME and others do is that they launch a systemd target/service which then starts the desktop and all applications run in the users scope.

Yeah, it is a bit unfortunate that we are cargo-culting this code around. There is a DBus API which will magically do the right thing for you, however, that is harder to use than this.

Multiple separate graphical logins of one user. multi-seat is supposed to continue working.
i.e. one graphical session per user. This single graphical session may span multiple seats in the future (but not multiple VTs on one seat).

How will this look like exactly? Multiple VTs?

No, one user cannot have multiple sessions across different VTs (assuming seat0). I don't think that seats other than seat0 actually have VTs, but I might be wrong there.

You first start a GNOME session (lets say normally through GDM) and then a non-GNOME one using startx. That way you can end up with two graphical sessions and the above code will give up.
With the similar code in mutter/GDM/PolicyKit/systemd-logind what will happen is that the guessing for applications in the GNOME sessions stops working suddenly. And then you will see weird stuff happening like PolicyKit refusing the session to set the brightness for the backlight.

Ok, so I guess this would be fragile.
If gnome ""fixes"" this into talking with systemd, a gnome session started from startx will also not be seen from sd_pid_get_session. That is fine with regards to a session opened in gdm since that is not supported.

The gain is that it closes an attack vector by the means of injecting content into /usr/lib(64) that could be directly executed when that is not expected. The code inside cannot be directly executed, only sourced by trusted binaries in /usr/(s)bin or /usr/libexec. It's about constraining paths to roles.

Udev already does not install stuff into /usr/lib64/udev. Helper scripts have long since been recommended to not be installed in the udev directories, either.

The gain is that it closes an attack vector by the means of injecting content
into `/usr/lib(64)` that could be directly executed when that is not expected.
Sure, I get that. Over-writing a script like /lib/brltty/systemd-wrapper could
be done,wouldn't be nice, and would be very naïvely executed.

I guess the critical word, here, is ""directly"".
The code inside _cannot_ be directly executed, only sourced by trusted
binaries in `/usr/(s)bin` or `/usr/libexec`.
What makes those directly executable binaries any more trustworthy. Any of them
could be overwritten just as easily as any script under /lib/. To me, binaries
aren't somehow more trustworthy than scripts.
It's about constraining paths to roles.
But, perhaps ignorantly, I don't see what the role difference is? Both are
software that users don't directly use but that are used to augment the
service(s) of the binaries that users do invoke.
In this instance, ""doing the right thing"" is following the conventions that
most (if not all) Autotools scripts would do for this.
As with everything, it's not easy for most of us to know what's become a truly
used and worthwhile convention and what's just a trend. I could, for exmple,
point to the (now rather ancient) devfs fad. I, for one, am sure glad that udev
replaced it. For a while, though, we were all effectively told to wholly
embrace it. I'll always end up doing ""the right thing"", but I'm cautious and do
need convincing.
It is not my intent to ""bully"" anyone into anything.
Yes, I know that. The general problem, though, is that innocent peolpe often
get caught up in systems and processes that do.

Please understand my position. I get a PR from someone I don't know that does
something rather invasive. I have a project who's integrity I ""work overtime""
to protect. I have a project that's highly trusted. What am I supposed to do?

What I did decide to do what just close the PR. If I then would get no response
then no big deal. If I then get a response then we can have a discussion. The
latter is what happened, and, for that, I'm grateful.

The only thing I regret is that this discussion didn't happen before the PR was
made. I think that'd have been a much better approach.

And, as I think I mentioned earlier but which you wouldn't have known at the
time, we did indeed have at least the systemd wrapper in /libexec/ (I think the
udev wrapper was in /lib/udev/). We were told that that was no good (I forget
the reason). My assumption was that, probably, some distributiion(s) just
didn't support doing things that way. You must understand that this, too,
factored into my first just not dealiong with, and then eventually closing, the
PR.
I originally made this patch to fix the build and install on Fedora and
openSUSE in a cleaner way than how it was done downstream
Hey! Fedora may not know it, but it's my friend. :-) It's the distribution that
I use.

Do you, by the way, work for one of them?
for the benefit for all consumers of brltty.
I understand.
Udev already does not install stuff into `/usr/lib64/udev`. Helper scripts
have long since been recommended to _not_ be installed in the udev
directories, either.
Okay, I didn't know that. I guess, when I look in /lib/udev/, I'm just then
seeing the list of projects that are either resisting or not caring. :-(
As for `.a` and `.so` code files, the long-term goal is to make it so that
those files are compiled as _non-executable_ content. There's work in package
build infrastructure to already start making this happen.
That's actually rather cool, though I don't understand how it would actually
improve things. Either way, the nature of a lib is to provide executable
functionality to a binary. Whether or not it's executable wouldn't change that.
For exmple, even a .a archive doesn't need to be executable. It's members are
simply loaded and the machine code contaioned therein is still blindly
executed.
But otherwise I'm not sure what you're saying here...
Maybe it's because you know far more about these things than I do (which is
entirely possible). I have no problem admitting that I don't know something,
and would much rather have a discussion than remain ignorant.

So, this discussion is actually very timely. We released 6.2 a few weeks ago,
and, for a number of reasons, I'm intending to release 6.2.1 in a couple of
weeks. If we include this then I'll call it 6.3 instead.

It's probably too late for PR266 to apply cleanly, but I don't mind looking at
what it does and reworking it.",True,{}

likely that the distribution that you're using hasn't defined it.

Ok, I was not aware of this. I have only found pulse-access mentioned together
with Pulse as system daemon, but I suppose you are right. I saw the pulse
group and thought it to be the right one. Please revert.

heard of that before. I think you're using Debian, and no ""Debian users have

I have been debugging BRLTTY ""as user"" for a while and had bluetooth
connectivity issues. I have retried it and it seems that the bluetooth group
is not required. My user used to be part of it so I expected this to be a
common pattern. So sorry, but this can be reverted then as well.

The scripts from the BRLTTY source link to `#!/bin/sh`, but use Bash syntax.
While a lot of distributions use sh and bash as synonyms, they are
unfortunately not. Maybe you could spell out bash in the interpreter line so
that it also works on Debian derivatives.

This isn't an issue as configure is derrived (by running autogen).

I'd much prefer migrating to an actual solution rather than to a stopgap measure. The current situation is, after all, working well enough.

Of course it'll get tested, but that isn't the point. Designers should test everything they submit - not just to brltty. By the time it reaches someone else for testing, there shouldn't be a problem. Of course there might be, but that's a different issue. Imperfection is expected, but carelessness shoudn't be. Just me giving a lecture.
> They wouldn't have deprecated something for which there isn't already a preferred replacement. Do you know what it is?

Oh, they did :D
Really? Maybe they think that pkg-config should now be used instead. That's imprecise, though, as it's not reasonable to expect ones use of pkg-config to match the interpreter that's been autodetected.

I also don't know what this issue has to do with building brltty for Chrome OS. I know that Google has been building brltty for that platform for a long time and this isn't an issue for them.

Actually it is. I am working with Google / ChromeOS / ChromiumOS and Gentoo for this. The idea is to block and fix mixed compiler toolchain usage. There are packages in CrOS & Gentoo which build using GCC/binutils tools even though the build should be using only Clang/LLVM. Brltty is one of them.
Here is a CrOS CL which adds some blocking logic which makes building brltty fail. This is only used to detect offenders for now, but we'd like to merge it after fixing the offenders.

Anyway, I think the goal is to not look for a tool if its associated environment variable is already set. If that's correct then please give me a list of all the ones you care about and I'll have a look at coding the change properly.

That is correct. The full list we're currently blocking in CrOS is gcc ld nm as objcopy strip ranlib. In the end we'd like to block all GNU tools for which an LLVM counterpart exists. From what I can see only ld, strip and ranlib are used in brltty.
