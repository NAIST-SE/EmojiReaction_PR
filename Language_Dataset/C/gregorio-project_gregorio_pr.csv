Snippets, on the other hand, pose a problem.  We use os.tmpname() to get a filename for writing the gabc from the snippet.  LuaTeX allows this, and the ""read anything"" typical permission for kpathsea will allow these to be read.  The current implementation (in this pull request) also uses os.tmpname() to get a filename for the log file.  However, the kpathsea inside the gregorio executable will reject a write to this file.
Should I disable the logging when using snippets?",True,{}

So, a separate gregorio package might not be needed any more, but perhaps we still need it for cutting-edge versions.  :-)
Anyhow, this pull request contains some updates to the Debian packaging in the debian/ directory.
A diversion (using dpkg-divert) is probably needed for /usr/bin/gregorio to override the same executable in Debian's texlive-binaries (TeX Live 2016) before the package is fit for upload to Debian ""unstable"".  But, oh well, I will work on it some other day.
Last but not least, thank you so much for bringing Gregorian chant to life!

Fixes #1180","@eroux Thank you for your review.  I am sorry that I had been very busy and still haven't found the time too follow up, especially in providing test cases in the gregorio-tests repository.
@rpspringuel Thank you so much for merging this pull request.  Unfortunately, I encountered a bug Saturday afternoon when I tried to change the Chinese font used in the translation, using \setmainjfont from luatexja-fontspec, lualatex crashed with this error:
! error:  (node lib): lua <node> expected, not an object with type nil

It crashed here:
  local trans_width = node.dimensions(glyphnode)
because glyphnode becomes nil with certain fonts, for reasons that still befuddles me.  (I know too little about TeX.)  Anyhow, my patch has wrongly assumed that the translation text would be enclosed in the glyph node directly within the hbox, as in vlist { hlist { glyph }}.  It turns out that, with some CJK fonts, the glyph node got wrapped into one deeper level, as in vlist { hlist { hlist { glyph } } }.
""Good fonts"" that work: ""Adobe Ming Std"", ""Adobe Song Std"", ""AR PL UKai TW"", ""AR PL UMing TW"", where a dump_nodes() would show this:
Module gregoriotex Info: node hlist [2] {1} on input line 63

Module gregoriotex Info: ..node rule [3] {1} on input line 63

Module gregoriotex Info: --end dump-- on input line 63

""Bad fonts"" that would crash: STZhongSong, Fandol, cwTeXKai, HanWangMingBold etc.
Module gregoriotex Info: node hlist [2] {1} on input line 63
Module gregoriotex Info: ..node whatsit [8] {1} on input line 63

Module gregoriotex Info: ..node glue [0] {1} on input line 63
Module gregoriotex Info: ..node glue [0] {1} on input line 63
Module gregoriotex Info: --end dump-- on input line 63

So, my quick fix is to check for nil right after the local glyphnode = get_first_node_by_id(glyph, hlistnode.head) line:
  if glyphnode == nil then
      glyphnode = get_first_node_by_id(hlist, hlistnode.head)
  end
Though probably it shouldn't be called a glyphnode any more.  This, fortunately, fixes the crash.  For example, cwTeXKai and Fandol works perfectly after this patch.
However, with STZhongSong and HanWangMingBold, there are the occasional translation text that are not quite centered but somehow shifted to the right.  But that is a relatively minor issue that shouldn't hold up 4.1.5.
So, @rpspringuel, would you like me to make a new pull request adding the check for nil?  Or would you like to do this yourself (and probably with a better fix)?  Please let me know.  Many thanks!
(I will be at the computer this morning standing by.  I will also try to upload my test files somewhere if you would like to take a look at them.)

But, if it is at all possible, please ""stop the press!"" and wait just a little bit longer (say an hour or two?) before you actually release 4.1.5: I found a bug in my code, in that when \setmainjfont is used to set the Chinese/Japanese font, the user is likely to run into this crash:
! error:  (node lib): lua <node> expected, not an object with type nil

For example, ""Adobe Ming Std"" and ""AR PL UKai TW"" work fine, but STZhongSong, Fandol, cwTeXKai etc. would crash... for some reasons, with some fonts, the glyph node isn't found within the hbox, but instead one level deeper.
I have a 3-line patch, not perfect, but at least no more crashing.
I will write more at #1180 or #1201.
Thanks again!",True,{}

I copied that from the manualinitialwidth code immediately below. I'm pretty sure it's there to handle relative dimensions like em since space@dimen macros are text.  Therefore, I don't think the style lines should be removed.

Because we laid so much groundwork for this, it took less time to implement than I thought, but I need help testing it in anything other than Linux.
I'm also not sure how to document this.  This is not a user-visible change, so it doesn't belong in CHANGELOG.md, and no entry is needed in UPGRADE.md.  As mentioned in #1292, it basically allows the build files to be set up for TeX Live.
Note: I changed @rpspringuel's code a bit because (1) redirection to /dev/null will likely not work under Windows, (2) to make executable check lazy, so it's only done (once per run) if needed, and (3) to try to find the suffixed executable before the suffix-less executable.

Would it be possible to use a sort of offset system?  I.e. set things up so that the 2, 3, 4, and 5 line variants of the bar lines always have the same relative location to each other in the code points.  We would then add a particular offset which corresponds to the number of lines to a base code point which corresponds to the kind of bar line.  Changing to a variant bar line, therefore, would be a matter of changing just the base code point (which should be fairly similar to the way our variant glyph system works for other glyphs), while changing the number of lines would be changing the offset.",True,{}

greextra.sfd has had some pretty major modifications over the years (in particular gresym.sfd was merged into it in 2015) so I'm going to say that this one should have the Copyright updated.

The font first appeared when mensural et al. clefs and custos were added in 2010.
@eroux, can you clarify the original history of this font?  In particular, did Matthew Spencer have anything to do with those original glyphs (i.e. only the font name in the copyright statement is in error) or was the whole statement accidently copied from greciliae?

semi-manual - the last line that wraps the initial must be manually ended in the gabc.  Should be slightly easier to use, but can lead to the initial overlapping full width staves when the manual line ending is far too early.

I'd like to make something which is fully automatic, but have yet to come up with a good way of tracking the automatic line endings.  I've identified a point in the post_linebreak function where the line numbers are increasing as expected, but I'm not sure how, or even if, I can resize the lines on the lua side.  Hence, I'm posting this here for some feedback.
Note: This still needs some documentation work and so is not ready for merge.","Getting the line height adjustments for variable line heights right is proving much harder than expected.  @henryso, can you look at the code in my most recent commit (39d9496) and see if I'm doing anything blatantly wrong.  Things aren't lining up as I would expect them to and I'm trying to figure out if that's do to my not understanding the way the line height information is stored and used, or if it's because there's something more subtle in the way the spacing around lines works.",True,{}

Is there a reason that gregorio does not ignore white space not contained between : and ; preceding the %% in a .gabc file?

The reason is mostly that we never thought about that possibility.  We always assumed that gabc file writing would be done by hand.  Unfortunately, scribus, while using an XML file to define a rendering frame, doesn't really understand the indentation of an XML file and thus sometimes thinks XML indentation should be part of the target file it's supposed to create.  Further, we actually need to write two files (the gabc and the tex file) while the render frame tool only expects to need to write one.  Thus we have to design the tex file to create the second automatically in a way that is compatible both with how Scribus interprets the XML and with how filecontents interprets its contents.  Getting such indirection right is complicated (especially since none of the developers actively use Scribus and thus testing requires one of us to relearn it each time we run into problems).
