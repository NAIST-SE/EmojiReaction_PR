Remarks / Known Issue:

This script is not callable from a different relativ path. Calling ./xxx/build-cli.py will lead to a build in
$BUILD_DIR/xxx/ wich leads to an error becaus the script will not find the ./autogen.sh and
./configure etc. -scripts in the $BUILD_DIR/package-to-compile-x.x.x -dir.

Changes:

Adding ./autogen.sh command before ./configure.
Disabeling version control / Commit-Id (search for CCNET_SOURCE_COMMIT_ID in script)

Todo:

Accept  libsearpc-3.0-latest.tar.gz as valid file formate.
Resolve known issue (see above).","Becaused the used path/file does not exist in the tar.gz
[EDIT:]
Ok here is the bigger answer. In get_source_commit_id(self) [line 174] You are looking for the file latest_commit.
This file does not exist by default. Only when you do a make dist-hook (?)
As this value is not relevant and not even used, why should we make it more complicated then nescarry? Especially when this is not a normal step of a build process.

seafile-daemon: built from haiwen/seafile project. It contains the syncing engine and libseafile library. There is no need to built a separate libseafile and libseafile-dev package. The dev headers is of no use since I can't think of any third-party will be interested in it. We can add it when there is such requirements later.
ccnet: built from haiwen/ccnet project. It contains the ccnet daemon and libccnet library. The current naming of libccnet is confusing. I suggest we change it to ccnet. It's a daemon, not a library.
seafile-gui: built from haiwen/seafile-client project. Actually seafile-gui is a more proper name for the project.
libsearpc: bulit from haiwen/libsearpc project.
seafile-client: a meta-package to install the above 4 packages.

Additionally we also provides a seafile-cli package.",True,{}

for instance, libccnet contains the shared libraries that are linked with seafile-applet, so there should remain the libccnet package (and ccnet and seafile-gui will depend on it).
at first i thought that naming the meta-package different from the large official binary was a problem. but this could even be an improvement, as i can add ""Conflicts: seafile"" to the control file to make replacing one with the other much cleaner.
i've noticed i'll also need to rename the library packages to reflect their SONAME, and add a *.symbols file to them. i'll let you know when i'm ready.",True,{}

seafile-gui (seafile desktop client)

i did not add another package called seafile-client because i noticed that seafile-gui does already fulfill the task. i.e., if you install seafile-gui, all necessary dependencies (including libsearpc1, ccnet and seafile-daemon) will be installed as well.
also, i did not yet add symbols files to the library packages. but what do you think so far?
i've set up a new, clean PPA with this packaging scheme, you can try/examine it here:
